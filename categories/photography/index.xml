&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://500px.com/photo/4714308&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pcdn.500px.net/4714308/cc7bd653dc8402e2871aee39975ca5463fa1f52b/4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Long exposures by Filip Bunkens (Pitslamp)) on 500px.com&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional photographer, I get to test new cameras when they are released. That&amp;rsquo;s how I got my hands on a Samsung NX200 for a couple of months now. This review is going to from a professional viewpoint, if you want a less technical review check out my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20120131_samsung_nx200&#34; title=&#34;Samsung NX200 review | PitsLamp&#34;&gt;PitsLamp blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nx200 is a mirror less camera system, with some pretty decent lenses. I&amp;rsquo;ll list the pro and cons of the camera and will explain some a bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pro:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Pro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty high fps in RAW (4) even higher in JPEG (7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice intuitive interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot shoe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very accessible buttons on the right locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good quality AMOLED display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good form factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;con:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Con&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot&amp;rsquo;s of noise above ISO 800&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow startup time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No viewfinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No swiveling display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the very short version of my likes and dislikes of the Samsung NX200. So now let me get into that in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;screen:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Screen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the screen is great, even in harsh sunlight. However, because of no viewfinder and no swiveling screen, it&amp;rsquo;s not always very easy to compose a shot. You are limited to how you can look at the screen. This means no shots low by the ground, or high above your head, because composing is not possible if you don&amp;rsquo;t see the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ease-of-use:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Ease of use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung always had a pretty good idea how to make a camera easy to use. The menu is clear, easy, logical. All the buttons are located very conveniently, at least for me they are. It&amp;rsquo;s a joy to use this camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However how hard Samsung keeps on trying to have me use the i-Function button on the lens, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care for it. It&amp;rsquo;s is one of their selling points since the nx100, it was made after the older rangefinder cameras where you could set almost everything on the lens. But where Samsung got it wrong for me, is that the button is never in the same place on the lenses. Also the first you use the button it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really react directly. Also the ring on the lens you can use to change the settings, is stepless, but the interface on the screen has steps, that&amp;rsquo;s confusing. So I prefer to use the buttons on top and on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;quality-and-speed:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Quality and speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slow startup speed, makes that you better don&amp;rsquo;t use the battery saving feature, if you want to photograph your kids, make sure you keep it on all the time. However once started, the speed is very good, a very decent fps even in RAW. On the other hand, once you want to look at the photos, it can take quite some time before the RAW&amp;rsquo;s are processed. So speed overall is not good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796342627/&#34; title=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6796342627_8e4fea1b01.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 20MP on the camera, the photos are of good quality, large, nice to look at in 100%. The camera is excellent for studio work in tight spaces, I did love it for product shots, especially with the 60mm macro lens. The hot shoe makes it possible to use radio triggers which again is awesome for studio shoots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a very big drawback, as with the first DSLR&amp;rsquo;s the camera, absolutely doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform well in low light conditions. For me in color the photos until 800 iso are acceptable, in b/w you can go up till 1600 but after that you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck. Too much noise, especially color noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about this camera. I do like the interface, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the quality of the photos. So if you are looking for a small, interchangeable camera with most use being during the day or in studio settings, definitely go for it. If you are looking for an allround camera, don&amp;rsquo;t go for this one, there are better alternatives out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sony Nex-5, hands-on Review</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was given the samsung NX10 to test for 10 days, I was also handed a sony nex-5 a couple of weeks ago to play with it for one week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing posting about this camera, because to be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it. The problem is not that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the format, the quality or the technical parts of it. Actually I was very excited about those beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I not like the camera, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t intuitive. I tried to get over it and carried it with me for the whole week. The menu is not very logical, when I got the camera, I popped in a sd-card and wanted to format the card before taking pictures. Too bad it took me over 5 minutes to locate the format option in the menu. Because once you are in the menu, there are several submenu&amp;rsquo;s but the problem is that they are located vertically below each other and the camera stops scrolling for a little bit once you reach the end of the first menu. So you assume you reached the end of the menu and need to continue in another menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to that I was very annoyed by the startup time, it takes the camera 3-4 seconds to be able to take a picture. That&amp;rsquo;s too long for me. When I turn on a camera I want to be able to use it and not wait and loose the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most annoying thing was the fact that once you entered either photo or video mode, you could not review the results of the other mode without going to the unlogical menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall the camera is very nice, it would have been a great competitor compared to the samsung NX10, but sadly enough I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of pictures because after the first day I got just very annoyed with it. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope sony fixes the each of use for their next release of this camera, it has a lot of potential but I would not recommend the camera to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Samsung NX10, hands on review</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20100721_samsung-nx10-hands-on-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I had the opportunity to play with the Samsung NX10 camera. As said in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/&#34; title=&#34;Samsung NX10&#34;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; I really liked the camera and that didn&amp;rsquo;t change during the 10 days I was allowed to use it. I even wanted to keep the camera with the 20mm pancake lens. Just because it is such an amazing small and convenient camera, it can go anywhere with you and it delivers great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the NX10 to shoot some behind the scene material during a wedding with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bertstephani.com&#34;&gt;Bert Stephani&lt;/a&gt;. The photos are taken with the 20mm pancake lens and as jpeg in monochrome mode. The results are very good and I like the speed, the sharpness and the fast focus it has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791201689/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4791201689_b7156075c9.jpg&#34; width=&#34;333&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791202209/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4791202209_1e48ba34f7.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791203085/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4791203085_ab5304223e.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also tried the NX10 during the &amp;#8220;dijlefeesten&amp;#8221; festival in my hometown and during some other low light conditions. The results are quite exceptional, the noise is very acceptable, that&amp;rsquo;s mainly because of the large sensor, it&amp;rsquo;s actually only a 1.5 crop factor. But not only the noise is very acceptable, the autofocus is also very good and fast even with the lights on stage flooding the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791838302/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4791838302_4cc8a52c73.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791208367/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4791208367_978509c572.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791840000/&#34; title=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4791840000_dbb4c00656.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[camera-test] Samsung NX10&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can keep on talking about the technical stuff of this camera. Samsung had to make some compromises to keep the camera small but the experience with this camera is just great, I mean it just awesome to use, it&amp;rsquo;s small, fast, easy to use, but most of all it&amp;rsquo;s fun to use. Samsung keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>samsung nx10</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last thursday samsung gave me a nx10 camera to play with for 10 days. The camera is something in between a micro four thirds and a entry level dslr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not planning on giving you a full technical test of this camera, for such a review I&amp;rsquo;ll point you towards [dpreview][1], who did an in depth review of the specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write a more once I have tested and worked with the camera for ten days. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m going to write down my first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is very lightweight, fast, easy to handle and produces pictures of astonishing quality for such a small camera. Because it works with the same size chip as the entry level dslr&amp;rsquo;s, the higher iso are acceptable in the tests I did so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I love most of the camera there are a couple things that need some work in my opinion. The real drawback is the electronic viewfinder. I understand they had to drop the optical viewfinder for an digital one to keep the body very small and lightweight. What I don&amp;rsquo;t get is that the viewfinder&amp;rsquo;s image quality is pretty bad. For sure if you compare it to the LCD on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing i don&amp;rsquo;t like is the manual focus. First you either have to select it on camera or on the lens depending on which lens you have mounted. That&amp;rsquo;s confusing and I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. Second the the viewfinder zooms to help you focus, but the zoom is just showing you the same info in 4 pixels as before in one pixel. This makes it very hard to focus because what you see is all the time a bit unsharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;m complaining about the manual focus I can only be amazed by how accurate and fast the autofocus is. It uses the contrast to focus which makes it hard to focus on a rather shallow contrast scene, but for any other circumstance it works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30mm f2 pancake lens is awesome but the kitlens (18-55mm) as with most entry level dslr&amp;rsquo;s isn&amp;rsquo;t very good. Although the image quality is pretty ok for a standard low quality lens what disturbs me is it&amp;rsquo;s size. The whole camera is build to being small and portable. With the kitlens the camera becomes bulky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pancake lenses are just great because of there compact size. Although at the moment you can only buy the 30mm f2, my contacts at Samsung Belgium have assured me that before the end of the year there will be a wider range of lenses available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said it would be a short review but it turned out to be an almost full review. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take some more photographs with the camera now and will include some in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vredebox</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20100502_vredebox/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.achter.be/20100502_vredebox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my grandparents died last year, my family and I had to clean out their house. I knew they had a very old camera on their chimney but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if it still worked. To my big surprise everything worked great, although it all could use a little cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started researching the camera on the internet and found that it&amp;rsquo;s a vredebox made by a German company called vredeborch in Friedeburg. The camera uses 120 film, has a meniscus lens with an aperture of f11. Fastest shutterspeed is 1/30th of a second. There are 3 levers on the side, one for stopping down the lens to f16 and the other 2 to use the bulb setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those settings are a bit of a let down, but I wanted to test it out anyway. So after &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pietervanimpe.com&#34; rel=&#34;friend met&#34; title=&#34;Pieter Van Impe&#34;&gt;Pieter&lt;/a&gt; gave me a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 pro, I started shooting with the vredebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, just so you know, the minimum focus distance on this camera is 3 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first post some results and then I&amp;rsquo;ll give a little review about the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569687736/&#34; title=&#34;[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3437/4569687736_dc9f8bb24e.jpg&#34; width=&#34;345&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This picture was taken on Ilford Delta 400 pro film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569688856/&#34; title=&#34;[vredebox] Lamot and Dijle by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4569688856_55e9661458.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;338&#34; alt=&#34;[vredebox] Lamot and Dijle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken on Ilford Delta 3200&amp;lt;/p?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569684332/&#34; title=&#34;[vredebox] Hotel Vé by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3498/4569684332_708d164f30.jpg&#34; width=&#34;342&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;[vredebox] Hotel Vé&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken on Ilford Delta 100 film&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow my progress with the vredebox, I suggest you follow this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157623847114053/&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34; title=&#34;[Film] Vredebox on flickr.com&#34;&gt;set on flickr&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the results there when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a short review of the camera. Although it&amp;rsquo;s technically not very good, I really like the box feeling and the way of taking pictures. Because of the lack of features or wide range of aperture and shutterspeed, I think a lot more before I make I picture. This makes that I&amp;rsquo;m more concentrating on the framing of the shot, which is not easy in the small viewfinder located at your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with the results of the box, a camera that&amp;rsquo;s at least 60 year old. It&amp;rsquo;s a decent and fun camera for hobby projects, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be playing with it a lot more in the future&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deranged: experimental treatment</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20100423_deranged-experimental-treatment/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.achter.be/20100423_deranged-experimental-treatment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the evening of Easter I found myself with some spare time. An idea started to form in my head, just for fun I wanted to recreate a movie poster. After a &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/Bunker/status/11601861573&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34; title=&#34;Bunker at twitter&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/defre&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;DeFre at twitter.com&#34;&gt;@DeFre&lt;/a&gt; became my instant model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left me just one hour to find a poster I wanted, think about how I would achieve the same look and prepare everything. I found this movie poster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.achter.be/wp-content/upload/crank2high.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Movie Poster for Crank 2 High Voltage&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because I knew &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/defre&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;DeFre at twitter.com&#34;&gt;Fré&lt;/a&gt; already, I was pretty sure it would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some tweaking in post processing and the addition of artificial smoke, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t gather enough smokers on a short notice, here is the result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4539647013/&#34; title=&#34;[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4539647013_541751701b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;341&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shoot was done in a total of 4 hours from idea till final image. I used 2 bowens gemini 500R studiolights with a bowens travelpak. The photo was taken in 20sec exposure while manually triggering the flashes 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the result but it&amp;rsquo;s a start. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot while doing this and most importantly we all had a lot of fun. Big thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/defre&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;DeFre at twitter.com&#34;&gt;Fré&lt;/a&gt; to go along with my crazy idea and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saravdv.be&#34; rel=&#34;sweetheart co-resident friend&#34; title=&#34;Sara Van de Velde&#34;&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt; for helping out, withstanding the cold and being the beer supplier of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
