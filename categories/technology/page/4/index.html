				<p>Today I&rsquo;m invited at the launch of the 3D tv in Brussels. I&rsquo;m live blogging from the event.</p>

<p>To start we have Bruno Tassert, product manager at Samsung. He&rsquo;s giving a product overview of the 3D collection of Samsung. It started in the eighties but with the clumsy glasses in cardboard it was not a real success. Until the film avatar last year 3D stayed without success. Today 3D is possible because the technology permits it. The movie studios have adopted the technology and now it&rsquo;s time for the consumer to use 3D in their own homes.</p>

<p>3D is basically two images who are projected next to each other. At first in 2 different colors but now the technology has evolved and uses different polarities in the glasses, this is the way it is used by the movie theaters, it&rsquo;s passive. The tech used in the in the samsung tv is with an active component in the glasses. One side is just shown on TV the other one is shown and filtered by the glasses. This technology uses 200mhz. This is called the shutter technique. The last way is like the photos in 3D which has the big disadvantage that you can&rsquo;t look at it from a side and the 2D experience really sucks. Although they all have their disadvantages, the shutter technique is the only one that makes it possible to show HD content.</p>

<p>As you would expect you can put the 2 different images side by side or on top of each other. Now we are getting in to the really technical stuff, so I&rsquo;m just going to skip that part if you want more info about it, you can search for it yourself on the Internet.</p>

<p>You have to choose for Samsung, according to them because they launched 3D as first and have all the other devices ready for it. But the most important reason is because they use conversion by object based depth processing, while the other ways of 3D just separate the objects in a vertical direction.</p>

<p>For 3D you only need a television, a blue Ray player and off course the glasses. There are 3 different types at the moment, ranging from 2000 to 5000+ euro for the LCD and LED. But they also have plasma. Next to that they also have the blue Ray player and the 3D home cinema. The glasses range from 79 euro for the children glasses and going up to 99 euro for the adult version. There are 2 sizes in adult sizes, because not everybody has the same face.</p>

<p>The content is available from movies, games like avatar which we can test here and there are a couple of channels that start their emissions in 3D</p>

<p>Now we arrive at the real history of 3D, in 1857 the first real 3D machine was build, in the 1950&rsquo;s there were already about 60 movies released in 3D, but it was a real PITA to watch a full length movie. In the sixties they tried some 3D in color but it still didn&rsquo;t work, after another try with Jaws they left the idea for a while. The first real 3D were the Imax movies in theme parks. That worked but it was very expensive and time consuming to make Imax movies. We had to wait till this century before they started to do some new things in 3D, where they started again with animation films and the real breakthrough was reached last summer with the release of several 3D movies.</p>

<p>Now we get a overview of what they showed in the Belgian pavilion</p>

<p>In 2005 they 5 biggest directors in Hollywood announced at DLP that 3D would be the future for the movies because that way it was almost impossible to pirate. Philips started with a project for 3D without glasses but had to stop production because it was too heavy, big and there was not enough quality.</p>

<p>There are apparently 2 different ways of filming, one is crossing the cameras, that&rsquo;s what is used by Cameron in Avatar. The other way is, like it&rsquo;s mainly used in Europe is by aligning the cameras parrallel which makes the images pop more. But on infinity it everything is in focus.</p>

<p>Now we have something to eat and will all participate in a quiz later on. My opinion on the whole experience I&rsquo;ll post later with some pictures. Stay tuned.</p>

				<p>I have had some crazy ideas before and I&rsquo;ve build quite a reputation of opening shops of my favourite brands and queueing for gadgets. When, last January I saw Steve jobs unveil the iPad, I was sold. I also knew I would be queueing for it when it became available in Europe.</p>

<p>So today was the day of the official release for the iPad In France. in the past days I have been researching a lot about the release on the internet. Well actually I was researching it with <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend collegue met" title="Pieter Van Impe">Pieter</a>, we first thought of going to the fnac in Lille. It turned we could be left without an iPad to buy, so we decided to go to Paris.</p>

<p>Tonight at midnight we left for Paris accompanied by <a href="http://www.saravdv.be">Sara</a> and <a href="http://www.davybuntinx.be">Davy</a>. We arrived at 3h30 and found a parking spot surprisingly easy just around the corner of the apple store. There were already 6 people in front of us, but at least we knew we would have an iPad and so the waiting began.</p>

<p>When the hour got closer, Pieter and I were wondering about which one we would get, while Sara was deciding if she would get one. Unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t have all the time waiting to decide because the press found out that there were some crazy Belgians in the queue. Most of them wanted to talk to us. We gave some interviews and were asked by a production crew of Apple to be followed while and after buying the iPad. We even got an iTunes gift certificate of 15â‚¬ out of it.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found all the links to the videos and articles yet but I&rsquo;ll add them once I&rsquo;ve found them.&lt;/&gt;</p>

<p>This post is typed on the iPad and I found it pretty pleasing to type a small blogpost like this one in the WP app. After playing with it for the last hour I&rsquo;m even more convinced that I wanted this device. I&rsquo;ll write a review and some app recommendations later aft i used it for an extended time.</p>

				<p>Last night <a title="Canvas" rel="none" href="http://www.canvas.be/">Canvas</a> aired the third episode of <a title="BBC" rel="none" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>&#8216;s internet documentary <a title="Virtual Revolution" rel="none" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution">The Virtual Revolution</a>. The virtual revolution was an an open and collaborative production, which encouraged the web audience to help shape the series. But not only that is what made the experience interactive, during the TV-show people were encouraged to tweet and start a discussion about the subject of that evening. Canvas does the same and even has a web only discussion panel after every episode. Although hugely interesting, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about it, you can check it out yourself at the <a title="The Virtual Revolution on Canvas" rel="none" href="http://programmas.canvas.be/the-virtual-revolution/">Canvas-website</a> or on twitter with the hashtag <a title="#virtualrevolution on Canvas" rel="none" href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23virtualrevolution">#virtualrevolution</a></p>

<p>While following the tweets I noticed that a lot of people are very naive about their data online. They seem to think that you can hide yourself forever behind a screenname and that facebook is evil, because of their privacy settings. Although I don&rsquo;t always agree with the policy of facebook, you won&rsquo;t hear me say that they are the only evil on today&rsquo;s web.</p>

<p>At a certain point in the discussion someone, whom I&rsquo;m not going to name, said, I don&rsquo;t use my name on the web, so it will be very difficult to find out who I am. To prove that it&rsquo;s definitely not only facebook that has a lot of data about you, I started by looking to the person&rsquo;s twitter account, there was a .be domain listed, I looked at the registry data for the domain. I found out a name but not yet the one I needed. By coupling that name to his nickname in google, I found within 7 minutes his real name, location, profession, likes and marriage status. This all without the use of facebook.</p>

<p>I think, most people don&rsquo;t realize what they are sharing and how easy it is to find that data. From the moment you are connected to the internet you are sharing a lot of information. You get personalized ads according to your search query, content of your mail, webpage you are visiting, location you are, &#8230; Everything you do on the web is recorded somewhere, somehow. Not only on the web btw, just think what&rsquo;s possible with fidelity cards or your bank card.</p>
