<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo_backblaze.gif"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo_backblaze.gif" alt="Backblaze" width="160" height="52" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271" /></a></p>

<p>Since I started using computers, I have had a mixed relation with backups. They are too much hassle to deal with, they fail, I didn&rsquo;t have enough space. But since the internet connections are able to handle all data I produce now, I decided to start using cloud backup. I&rsquo;v chosen <a href="http://www.backblaze.com" title="Online Backup &#038; Data Backup Software" rel="none">Backblaze cloud backup</a>.</p>

<p>I had and still have a fully installed and running local backup system. But it took me a while to figure out an easy way to have a offsite backup for my photography. The problem is that having an off site backup used to be a lot of work, I tried several ways, but never found a way that worked reliably and wasn&rsquo;t a lot of work.</p>

<p>The only easy way, was and still is by uploading everything, but the problem in Belgium was that there were up and download limits set by the providers. Even today on the &#8220;unlimited&#8221; packages there still is a kind of restriction, it is around 500 gb to 1TB a month depending on the area you live in.</p>

<h4 id="why-backblaze">Why Backblaze?</h4>

<p>After extensively researching the different solutions, I decide to go with <a href="http://www.backblaze.com" title="Online Backup &#038; Data Backup Software" rel="none">Backblaze</a>, because of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backup external drives</li>
<li>Throttle upload speed of your data when needed</li>
<li>Ship backup drives worldwide</li>
<li>Only 4$ a month if you choose the 2 year plan</li>
<li>Unlimited backup space</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I found, there are no other services that offer all these options for that money.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4>

<p>It works great, after subscribing and paying with your credit card, you download and install the program for your OS. Backblaze will start to upload data from your internal drives. If you want to add more drives, just select it in the preferences pane. If you have upload limits, you can choose to throttle the speed and Blackblaze gives you an estimate how much it will upload during a day.</p>

<p>A few figures to give you an idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.2 TB data backed up</li>
<li>Initial backup took 3.5 months</li>
<li>Restored main OS X data once</li>
<li>Restored 35 GB in a zip-file</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-it-good">Is it good?</h4>

<p>Although it took almost 4 months of backing up, it was no hassle, Backblaze just worked. Restoring was just a matter of selecting the files I wanted, waiting for the zip to be generated and then downloading it.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not all good, the restore process sucks. You&rsquo;ll get all your files back, but it&rsquo;s up to you to put them all back where they belong. That&rsquo;s no fun, let me tell you. You have to deal with permissions, finding the correct folder and so on. Another annoyance, is the fact that after the restore, my secondary internal drive was no longer recognized as being the same drive, so it had to be backed up again, like the replaced primary drive. Why?</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion?</h4>

<p>Backblaze is a great solution for an off site backup, but it takes a while to get all your data backed up, my suggestion let me send you guys a drive with my data for an extra cost, like crashplan does. When you have to restore, it&rsquo;s all manual labour. I would suggest that they implement some sort of restore program that does most of the work for you.</p>

<p>Despite the remarks I have, I&rsquo;m a satisfied <a href="http://www.backblaze.com" title="Online Backup &#038; Data Backup Software" rel="none">Backblaze cloud backup</a> user and would recommend it to everybody</p>

				<p><strong>Update: after 5 months this Kingston 3K hyperX SSD completely died on me</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hyperx.jpg"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hyperx.jpg" alt="Kingston 3K HyperX SSD" width="550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267" /></a></p>

<p>At the end of june, my girflfriend (<a href="http://www.saravdv.be" rel="friend muse" title="Saravdv: there are no endings, only new beginnings">SaraVdV</a>) got a mail from <a href="http://www.kingston.com" title="Kingston Technology" rel="contact">Kingston</a> if she and I wanted to test a new SSD drive from Kingston.</p>

<p>After some mailing back and forth, because Sara and I both work on mac&rsquo;s, Kingston send us both a 256GB HyperX 3K SSD drive. It comes in a nice package, with an external usb enclosure and it&rsquo;s own screwdriver. Which is always very handy. The drives we received were 2.5&#8243; drives, but included in the package you buy, there&rsquo;s also a 3.5&#8243; bay.</p>

<p>Because it would be easier from me to put the drive in the MacBook pro 15&#8243; begin 2009 I have, than to put it in an iMac. I started with that computer, the drive is as easy to install as any drive. However when I booted the mac and started installing OS X I ran into some problems.</p>

<p>At first the install of OS X stalled a couple of times, when I finally managed to install it correctly, I had a 25 sec spinning beachball every 2 minutes. However, because we had review drives, I contacted Kingston directly and started to work out the problem with Mario, on of the engineers at Kingston who developed the drive. Turns out that there is an incompatibility between the nvidia SATA I controller in the MacBook 5.1 and the driver for SATA II or III SSD&rsquo;s in OS X leopard or later. This makes that every time there is a lot of writing activity to the disk that the controller locks the OS for a while untill the buffers are cleared. So I ended up restoring this MacBook to it&rsquo;s original config. This is not a fault of the kingston drive but an Apple problem, because I also experienced the same behaviour with another brand of SSD&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>After my debacle with the drive in the Macbook 5.1, I also installed the drive in Sara&rsquo;s iMac which is not too big of a hassle if you follow all the guides online for replacing a drive in an iMac. I have not had any problems with installing the drive and reinstalling OS X, nor has Sara experienced any problems since the drive was installed.</p>

<p>In July I purchased myself a new 13&#8243; MacBook pro and installed the HyperX SSD in that computer. No problems, everything installs and works perfect.</p>

<p>Performance wise, everything seems a lot quicker on the iMac of Sara, boot times improved a lot. Every program launches faster and the drive behaves very well under pressure. We didn&rsquo;t do any graphs or charts, because in the end it all comes down to how you preceive the change.</p>

<p>For the MacBook 13&#8243; I did some testing. Without SSD it cold booted in 34 seconds, after install of the SSD it cold boots in 8secs. That&rsquo;s just amazing. It feels more instant now then waking my iPad first generation from sleep. Programs are launching very fast, lightroom which is the most important program for me, launches in less then 3 seconds in grid view. It all feels very snappy and instant. I haven&rsquo;t seen a beachball in months. Reboots are only necessary for updates from the OS. It just works and feels fast. It does what I expected an SSD to do.</p>

<p>The nicest surprise is that we may keep the drives, so I got a nice upgrade for my new MacBook thanks to Kingston.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: in minutes of me posting this tutorial, my airport utility got an update to v6.0 and all I said is obsolete, my WDS network still works, but I don&rsquo;t know yet how to set it up correctly.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-11.46.31.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-11.46.31.png" alt="" title="Airport_admin_utility" width="500"class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197" /></a></p>

<p>Over here we have a nice setup for our wireless network and playing music in all the rooms of our house. It&rsquo;s supported by Apple airports. As you can see in the above screenshot. We use an Airport extreme as the router and 3 Airport expresses as relays. Last saturday evening however, disaster struck and our Airport extreme died. Well it did not die completely, it stopped serving internet through the wifi connections and there was only connection via ethernet connections. The wifi clients however could still connect, authenticate and got an ip-address, but there it all stopped. I tried everything to restore the connections, but despite all my efforts for about 3 hours. Rebooting, resetting, hard resetting nothing worked. So I setup a temporary solution and went out today to get a new Airport extreme.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the technical part of this article. How do you setup a network of 4 airports across the house on the same network with wpa2 security enabled? The first and most important step is to hard reset all the airports, the only way to do that if the airports don&rsquo;t come straight from the box is to hold down the little reset button while pluggin in the airport. If you don&rsquo;t know how, check this <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3728" title="Reset airport" rel="none">support-page</a> on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple website" rel="none">Apple</a>.</p>

<h3 id="configure-the-base-station-or-wds-main">Configure the base station or WDS main</h3>

<p>You start by selecting manual configuration in the airport utility, don&rsquo;t use the wizard, as you will not be able to setup WDS. On the next screen, you&rsquo;ll see a couple of tabs, but none of them shows WDS, at least when you have a recent airport extreme.</p>

<ol>
<li>Now setup your Base Station like always, fill out the name, choose a password, &#8230; under the Base Station tab.</li>
<li>The next tab is the Wireless tab, this is 1 of the 2 tabs where all the magic will happen.<br />
<a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.35.43.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.35.43.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 21.35.43" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-203" /></a><br />
In the dropdown menu next to &#8220;Wireless Mode&#8221; select &#8220;Participate in a WDS network&#8221;, if you don&rsquo;t see it, hold down the &#8220;option&#8221; key, it will magically appear.</li>
<li>You setup your network as always, but make sure you select the checkbox &#8220;Allow this network to be extended&#8221;, leave the Radio mode on Automatic, choose WPA/WPA2 Personal, choose a password, go to the Wireless Network Options, set your country and leave all the rest. (<em>Hint:</em> Write down all settings, we&rsquo;ll need them later)</li>

<li><p>Next is the WDS tab, that has appeared after you selected &#8220;Participate in a WDS network&#8221; in the previous step. Select &#8220;WDS main&#8221; in the dropdown from &#8220;WDS Mode&#8221;. Select the checkbox next to &#8220;Allow wireless clients&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.47.50.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.47.50.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 21.47.50" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-209" /></a><br />
Fill in the Airport ID&rsquo;s of the soon to be remotes, you find the airport ID&rsquo;s on the bottom of the airport it should be a string of 12 alphanumeric characters.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That are all the steps for the configuring the base station.</p>

<h3 id="configure-the-wds-remotes">Configure the WDS remotes</h3>

<p>For configuring the remotes, repeat steps 1 till 3 exactly as in configuring the WDS main station. Make sure you have all the wireless settings exactly the same, as for the WDS main station. Make sure you did not miss any setting and if you must choose a channel set it to 11, because otherwise the remote station can&rsquo;t connect with the WDS main.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-22.16.46.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-22.16.46.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 22.16.46" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-211" /></a></p>

<p>To finish the setup, go to the WDS tab and choose for &#8220;WDS remote&#8221; in the drop down next to &#8220;WDS Mode&#8221;. Select the checkbox next to &#8220;Allow wireless clients&#8221; and fill in the Airport ID of the &#8220;WDS main&#8221;, update and test.</p>

<p>Repeat the steps for the airport remote for as many times you need it. You should now be able to use the network and if you activated airplay under &#8220;Music&#8221; you should be able to play music through every airport with boxes or a headphone connected.</p>

<p>A last piece of advice, if you configured a airport and it doesn&rsquo;t connect or shows up, put in a ethernet cable so that you can access it again. This will save you a lot of time, because the only other option is hard resetting the airport.</p>

				<p>Yesterday, I got invited to the logitech magic event in Belgium together with some other bloggers. We rode out to Arquennes about 30 minutes from Brussels in Henegouwen. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne and a short explanation of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wim_wauters" title="Wim Wauters, on Twitter" rel="contact met">@wimwauters</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images.png" alt="" title="ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images" width="455" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178" /></a></p>

<p>We got a tour around all the different products and in the mean time, there was a contest organized. I saw some nice products, but the most are not suited for me, because I have a fondness of the keyboards and mice/trackpads from Apple. The keys are just nicer from apple then any other keyboard I have used. However the accessoires for the ipad were very interesting, sadly enough the most interesting ones, like the keyboard cover are not suited for my iPad 1. But I can understand why a company developing products for Apple lines, are developing for the current versions alone.</p>

<p>The contest had a pretty interesting take, because Logitech and Hill and Knowlton anticipated that we would cheat.  <img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />So they had a guess question included, which was how many tweets with the logitechmagic tag would be posted between 20 and 22h during the evening. As everybody was working together on finding the answers to the questions this actually was the only relevant question to receive the prices.</p>

<p>The range of prices was impressive, there was a surround system with a value of 350 euro to mice of 30 euro. But at least everybody got a price. I managed to get a set of Logitech 600vi in-ear phones. I&rsquo;m currently testing them and I have to say the are amazingly great. These earphones are from the ultimate ear line, which is the same product line where a lot of professional musician are wearing headphones from during their concerts. The pair Sara and I got have a price value of 109 euro, which for me is very steep. That price means I would have never bought them myself, because I have a very bad track record with headphones. They tend to lay around and get tangled, ripped, get loose connections and so on.</p>

<p>These seem very nicely and sturdy designed, so we&rsquo;ll see how they handle my abuse in the long run. The sound experience is quite impressive. I get a wide range of tones without any distortion or scrambling. The nice part is that there is a whole range of foam and plastic tips so you can choose the ones that fit your ear very nicely. I have a rather small ear channel and most tips don&rsquo;t fit my ears, but the ones with the logitech ear phones actually fit my ear quite comfortable. I&rsquo;m wearing them already several hours in a row, without getting any problems with having them falling out of my ear or without any discomfort. So my initial experience with these in-ear phones is very positive. So thanks a lot Logitech for a quite expensive goodie of good quality.</p>
