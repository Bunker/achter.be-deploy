				<p>Yesterday, I got invited to the logitech magic event in Belgium together with some other bloggers. We rode out to Arquennes about 30 minutes from Brussels in Henegouwen. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne and a short explanation of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wim_wauters" title="Wim Wauters, on Twitter" rel="contact met">@wimwauters</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images.png" alt="" title="ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images" width="455" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178" /></a></p>

<p>We got a tour around all the different products and in the mean time, there was a contest organized. I saw some nice products, but the most are not suited for me, because I have a fondness of the keyboards and mice/trackpads from Apple. The keys are just nicer from apple then any other keyboard I have used. However the accessoires for the ipad were very interesting, sadly enough the most interesting ones, like the keyboard cover are not suited for my iPad 1. But I can understand why a company developing products for Apple lines, are developing for the current versions alone.</p>

<p>The contest had a pretty interesting take, because Logitech and Hill and Knowlton anticipated that we would cheat.  <img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />So they had a guess question included, which was how many tweets with the logitechmagic tag would be posted between 20 and 22h during the evening. As everybody was working together on finding the answers to the questions this actually was the only relevant question to receive the prices.</p>

<p>The range of prices was impressive, there was a surround system with a value of 350 euro to mice of 30 euro. But at least everybody got a price. I managed to get a set of Logitech 600vi in-ear phones. I&rsquo;m currently testing them and I have to say the are amazingly great. These earphones are from the ultimate ear line, which is the same product line where a lot of professional musician are wearing headphones from during their concerts. The pair Sara and I got have a price value of 109 euro, which for me is very steep. That price means I would have never bought them myself, because I have a very bad track record with headphones. They tend to lay around and get tangled, ripped, get loose connections and so on.</p>

<p>These seem very nicely and sturdy designed, so we&rsquo;ll see how they handle my abuse in the long run. The sound experience is quite impressive. I get a wide range of tones without any distortion or scrambling. The nice part is that there is a whole range of foam and plastic tips so you can choose the ones that fit your ear very nicely. I have a rather small ear channel and most tips don&rsquo;t fit my ears, but the ones with the logitech ear phones actually fit my ear quite comfortable. I&rsquo;m wearing them already several hours in a row, without getting any problems with having them falling out of my ear or without any discomfort. So my initial experience with these in-ear phones is very positive. So thanks a lot Logitech for a quite expensive goodie of good quality.</p>

				<p>After more than 2 months using the Navibot, I want to give you a review. Let me say, we&rsquo;re pretty pleased with the Robot vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a total solution for cleaning, it does a very good job keeping the house clean, when you set it on a daily routine. It takes a structured path, which takes it through the most part of the room. During it&rsquo;s path, it tries to cover the whole area, but misses some spots. Luckily it doesn&rsquo;t take the same path everyday and does the missed spots the next day.</p>

<p>Once a week we empty the container containing the dust and hairs,. So it doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of maintanance but whenever you forget about putting away all toys for the cat or the floorcloths, we use as doormats, something is bound to get stuck in the rotating brushes. Then the robot stops and starts beeping, until you fix the problem, that&rsquo;s annoying and drives our cat crazy when we aren&rsquo;t at home. But apart from that, it doesn&rsquo;t get trapped under furniture, it doesn&rsquo;t wrecks anything around the home. It only bumps into the furniture that has legs that are smaller than 5cm because it is in the blind spot of the sensors. Even when it does bump into your furniture, it doesn&rsquo;t really damages it, because of the rubber bumpers.</p>

<p>The only very annoying thing about the robot is whenever you use the guards, it gets confused because the beam of the guard spreads wider then you intend and that leaves areas around the guard without cleaning. Our robot also had a little defect, which broke the system that makes the back brush rotate and we had to send it in for repair. Since then it drives around and cleans the whole area very good.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a decent robot vacuum cleaner, then this is definitely what you need. It does a really good job keeping the house clean, without you lifting a finger, it&rsquo;s definitely not perfect but it&rsquo;s a great aid. For us it is a great tool and definitely cheaper than paying a cleaning lady. So yes, it&rsquo;s an expensive buy, but it will pay off after a while, because maintenance is not expensive at all. Even after 2 months we didn&rsquo;t have to change any of the brushes.</p>

				<p>This is a quote from &#8220;The Social Network&#8221;, the movie I was invited to watch yesterday in a screening together with some other bloggers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The social network&#8221; is the film about Marc Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook.com, a site I and probably you use every day. That for starters makes it very weird to watch the movie. I knew a bit about how the story of facebook goes and have to say, it stays very close to what happened in real life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not that big of a film geek, that I know what the director made before and what the main actors are known for, but I can appreciate a good movie and have some attention for how the film is filmed. The first thing I noticed is a very distinctive style of filming and the great use of subtle light. That makes a movie already more interesting for me. Also the fact that I&rsquo;m a geek, helps when the movie is about a geek creating the biggest social network.</p>

<p>The movie was very fastpaced and has two law suits from in the first years of facebook nicely intertwined with the story of how facebook grew from an idea to having 1 billion members. At moments it is a bit too fast to follow, so you&rsquo;ll probably miss a lot of subtle humour. But at other moments the story seemed to drag along, with the biggest anticlimax the launch of thefacebook.com. Just a press on a button and that was it, not even a beer was cracked at that moment. A bit pity but if that&rsquo;s the way it went, although just for the film&rsquo;s sake I would have put it in, anyway.</p>

<p>Although 2 hours is already pretty long for a movie, I found it disappointing that the biggest move facebook ever made, was not included in the film. I mean the film stopped at moving over to the UK universities and reaching there 1 billion members. I would have loved to see how it all grew and why they made the brightest and biggest move facebook could ever make, which was giving up being exclusive and going open to everybody, so that you and I now can be on facebook too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out the feeling that I have after seeing the movie. I liked it, I liked it a lot. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a movie that will be a big hit, because of the niche of people that it will appeal to. I will definitely see it again, when it comes on tv or on dvd, if not only to figure out the feeling I&rsquo;m left with.</p>

<p>Enjoy the trailer and thx <a href="http://www.adhese.com" rel="contact met" title="adhese.com">Adhese</a> for inviting me.</p>
