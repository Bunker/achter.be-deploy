<p>As a professional photographer, I get to test new cameras when they are released. That&rsquo;s how I got my hands on a Samsung NX200 for a couple of months now. This review is going to from a professional viewpoint, if you want a less technical review check out my <a href="http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20120131_samsung_nx200" title="Samsung NX200 review | PitsLamp">PitsLamp blog</a>.</p>

<p>The nx200 is a mirror less camera system, with some pretty decent lenses. I&rsquo;ll list the pro and cons of the camera and will explain some a bit lower.</p>

<h3 id="pro:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Pro</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pretty high fps in RAW (4) even higher in JPEG (7)</li>
<li>Nice intuitive interface</li>
<li>Hot shoe</li>
<li>Very accessible buttons on the right locations</li>
<li>Good quality AMOLED display</li>
<li>20 MP</li>
<li>Good form factor</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="con:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Con</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lot&rsquo;s of noise above ISO 800</li>
<li>Slow startup time</li>
<li>No viewfinder</li>
<li>No swiveling display</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s the very short version of my likes and dislikes of the Samsung NX200. So now let me get into that in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="screen:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Screen</h3>

<p>The quality of the screen is great, even in harsh sunlight. However, because of no viewfinder and no swiveling screen, it&rsquo;s not always very easy to compose a shot. You are limited to how you can look at the screen. This means no shots low by the ground, or high above your head, because composing is not possible if you don&rsquo;t see the screen.</p>

<h3 id="ease-of-use:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Ease of use</h3>

<p>Samsung always had a pretty good idea how to make a camera easy to use. The menu is clear, easy, logical. All the buttons are located very conveniently, at least for me they are. It&rsquo;s a joy to use this camera.</p>

<p>However how hard Samsung keeps on trying to have me use the i-Function button on the lens, I don&rsquo;t really care for it. It&rsquo;s is one of their selling points since the nx100, it was made after the older rangefinder cameras where you could set almost everything on the lens. But where Samsung got it wrong for me, is that the button is never in the same place on the lenses. Also the first you use the button it doesn&rsquo;t really react directly. Also the ring on the lens you can use to change the settings, is stepless, but the interface on the screen has steps, that&rsquo;s confusing. So I prefer to use the buttons on top and on the back.</p>

<h3 id="quality-and-speed:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Quality and speed</h3>

<p>A slow startup speed, makes that you better don&rsquo;t use the battery saving feature, if you want to photograph your kids, make sure you keep it on all the time. However once started, the speed is very good, a very decent fps even in RAW. On the other hand, once you want to look at the photos, it can take quite some time before the RAW&rsquo;s are processed. So speed overall is not good enough for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796342627/" title="[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6796342627_8e4fea1b01.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540" /></a></p>

<p>With 20MP on the camera, the photos are of good quality, large, nice to look at in 100%. The camera is excellent for studio work in tight spaces, I did love it for product shots, especially with the 60mm macro lens. The hot shoe makes it possible to use radio triggers which again is awesome for studio shoots.</p>

<p>But there is a very big drawback, as with the first DSLR&rsquo;s the camera, absolutely doesn&rsquo;t perform well in low light conditions. For me in color the photos until 800 iso are acceptable, in b/w you can go up till 1600 but after that you&rsquo;re out of luck. Too much noise, especially color noise.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion:dc02c572c8d9289a559f26ff553e8cc5">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I have mixed feelings about this camera. I do like the interface, but I don&rsquo;t like the quality of the photos. So if you are looking for a small, interchangeable camera with most use being during the day or in studio settings, definitely go for it. If you are looking for an allround camera, don&rsquo;t go for this one, there are better alternatives out there.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: in minutes of me posting this tutorial, my airport utility got an update to v6.0 and all I said is obsolete, my WDS network still works, but I don&rsquo;t know yet how to set it up correctly.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-11.46.31.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-11.46.31.png" alt="" title="Airport_admin_utility" width="500"class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197" /></a></p>

<p>Over here we have a nice setup for our wireless network and playing music in all the rooms of our house. It&rsquo;s supported by Apple airports. As you can see in the above screenshot. We use an Airport extreme as the router and 3 Airport expresses as relays. Last saturday evening however, disaster struck and our Airport extreme died. Well it did not die completely, it stopped serving internet through the wifi connections and there was only connection via ethernet connections. The wifi clients however could still connect, authenticate and got an ip-address, but there it all stopped. I tried everything to restore the connections, but despite all my efforts for about 3 hours. Rebooting, resetting, hard resetting nothing worked. So I setup a temporary solution and went out today to get a new Airport extreme.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the technical part of this article. How do you setup a network of 4 airports across the house on the same network with wpa2 security enabled? The first and most important step is to hard reset all the airports, the only way to do that if the airports don&rsquo;t come straight from the box is to hold down the little reset button while pluggin in the airport. If you don&rsquo;t know how, check this <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3728" title="Reset airport" rel="none">support-page</a> on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple website" rel="none">Apple</a>.</p>

<h3 id="configure-the-base-station-or-wds-main:f0747a94ba74626be30e9712b67e6fe6">Configure the base station or WDS main</h3>

<p>You start by selecting manual configuration in the airport utility, don&rsquo;t use the wizard, as you will not be able to setup WDS. On the next screen, you&rsquo;ll see a couple of tabs, but none of them shows WDS, at least when you have a recent airport extreme.</p>

<ol>
<li>Now setup your Base Station like always, fill out the name, choose a password, &#8230; under the Base Station tab.</li>
<li>The next tab is the Wireless tab, this is 1 of the 2 tabs where all the magic will happen.<br />
<a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.35.43.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.35.43.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 21.35.43" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-203" /></a><br />
In the dropdown menu next to &#8220;Wireless Mode&#8221; select &#8220;Participate in a WDS network&#8221;, if you don&rsquo;t see it, hold down the &#8220;option&#8221; key, it will magically appear.</li>
<li>You setup your network as always, but make sure you select the checkbox &#8220;Allow this network to be extended&#8221;, leave the Radio mode on Automatic, choose WPA/WPA2 Personal, choose a password, go to the Wireless Network Options, set your country and leave all the rest. (<em>Hint:</em> Write down all settings, we&rsquo;ll need them later)</li>

<li><p>Next is the WDS tab, that has appeared after you selected &#8220;Participate in a WDS network&#8221; in the previous step. Select &#8220;WDS main&#8221; in the dropdown from &#8220;WDS Mode&#8221;. Select the checkbox next to &#8220;Allow wireless clients&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.47.50.png"><img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-21.47.50.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 21.47.50" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-209" /></a><br />
Fill in the Airport ID&rsquo;s of the soon to be remotes, you find the airport ID&rsquo;s on the bottom of the airport it should be a string of 12 alphanumeric characters.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That are all the steps for the configuring the base station.</p>

<h3 id="configure-the-wds-remotes:f0747a94ba74626be30e9712b67e6fe6">Configure the WDS remotes</h3>

<p>For configuring the remotes, repeat steps 1 till 3 exactly as in configuring the WDS main station. Make sure you have all the wireless settings exactly the same, as for the WDS main station. Make sure you did not miss any setting and if you must choose a channel set it to 11, because otherwise the remote station can&rsquo;t connect with the WDS main.</p>

<p>[<img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-30-at-22.16.46.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2012-01-30 at 22.16.46" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-211" />][4]</p>

<p>To finish the setup, go to the WDS tab and choose for &#8220;WDS remote&#8221; in the drop down next to &#8220;WDS Mode&#8221;. Select the checkbox next to &#8220;Allow wireless clients&#8221; and fill in the Airport ID of the &#8220;WDS main&#8221;, update and test.</p>

<p>Repeat the steps for the airport remote for as many times you need it. You should now be able to use the network and if you activated airplay under &#8220;Music&#8221; you should be able to play music through every airport with boxes or a headphone connected.</p>

<p>A last piece of advice, if you configured a airport and it doesn&rsquo;t connect or shows up, put in a ethernet cable so that you can access it again. This will save you a lot of time, because the only other option is hard resetting the airport.</p>

				<p>Yesterday, I got invited to the logitech magic event in Belgium together with some other bloggers. We rode out to Arquennes about 30 minutes from Brussels in Henegouwen. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne and a short explanation of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wim_wauters" title="Wim Wauters, on Twitter" rel="contact met">@wimwauters</a>.</p>

<p>[<img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images.png" alt="" title="ultimate-ears-600vi-noise-isolating-headset-glamour-images" width="455" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178" />][1]</p>

<p>We got a tour around all the different products and in the mean time, there was a contest organized. I saw some nice products, but the most are not suited for me, because I have a fondness of the keyboards and mice/trackpads from Apple. The keys are just nicer from apple then any other keyboard I have used. However the accessoires for the ipad were very interesting, sadly enough the most interesting ones, like the keyboard cover are not suited for my iPad 1. But I can understand why a company developing products for Apple lines, are developing for the current versions alone.</p>

<p>The contest had a pretty interesting take, because Logitech and Hill and Knowlton anticipated that we would cheat.  <img src="http://www.achter.be/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />So they had a guess question included, which was how many tweets with the logitechmagic tag would be posted between 20 and 22h during the evening. As everybody was working together on finding the answers to the questions this actually was the only relevant question to receive the prices.</p>

<p>The range of prices was impressive, there was a surround system with a value of 350 euro to mice of 30 euro. But at least everybody got a price. I managed to get a set of Logitech 600vi in-ear phones. I&rsquo;m currently testing them and I have to say the are amazingly great. These earphones are from the ultimate ear line, which is the same product line where a lot of professional musician are wearing headphones from during their concerts. The pair Sara and I got have a price value of 109 euro, which for me is very steep. That price means I would have never bought them myself, because I have a very bad track record with headphones. They tend to lay around and get tangled, ripped, get loose connections and so on.</p>

<p>These seem very nicely and sturdy designed, so we&rsquo;ll see how they handle my abuse in the long run. The sound experience is quite impressive. I get a wide range of tones without any distortion or scrambling. The nice part is that there is a whole range of foam and plastic tips so you can choose the ones that fit your ear very nicely. I have a rather small ear channel and most tips don&rsquo;t fit my ears, but the ones with the logitech ear phones actually fit my ear quite comfortable. I&rsquo;m wearing them already several hours in a row, without getting any problems with having them falling out of my ear or without any discomfort. So my initial experience with these in-ear phones is very positive. So thanks a lot Logitech for a quite expensive goodie of good quality.</p>

<p>As a huge Apple fanboy, it&rsquo;s a very sad day for me. Steve Jobs just announced his resignation as a CEO of Apple inc. Below you find the most significant part from his resignation letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><em>Steve Jobs &#8211; Resignation Letter august 24, 2011</em></small></p>

<p>We all know that Steve&rsquo;s health was on a bad streak, starting with his pancreas cancer in 2006, his liver transplant in 2009 and the indefinite leave of absence due to health issues. Every keynote we saw a sleeker and sleeker Steve at this rate, he would be no more than a skeleton by the release of the iPhone 6. But I hoped that Steve would recover and kick some more butt in the years to come. Sadly that won&rsquo;t be true anymore. Let&rsquo;s just hope, that Steve can now focus on his health a bit more.</p>

<p>Why do I say, the end of an era? A look at his track record, which reads like a good novel and is a string of successes, says it all. The story starts in 1976 with the release of the Apple I, a computer built in a garage by 2 very young guys, dreaming that one day they could earn a profit from it. Little would they know that was the beginning of a dream come true. Although Wozniak left Apple and Jobs was fired in the nineties and hired back afterwards, in which time he founded, build and make Pixar huge. Now Apple not only has produced great products, but it has also become the biggest company in the world.</p>

<p>With Jobs now resigning as CEO I still believe in Apple and they will keep on producing great products, but there won&rsquo;t be anymore iconic black turtle necks, no more casual &#8220;There&rsquo;s one more thing&#8221; to drop a bomb on a market. I fear that the cult of mac, will no longer exist, it has lost it leader. Apple will probably become a dull company that still makes great products, but doesn&rsquo;t have me sitting in suspense during a keynote what they will announce.</p>

<p>Off course Jobs is not without fault, I&rsquo;m the first to admit it, but he is kind of a hero for me. Creating a company from scratch and making it this big, but still maintaining the suspense when announcing something new. There is no other company that I know of where one man had such an impact on the development, announcement and sales of a product that nobody needed before it was announced. It also takes a great man, to resign due to health reasons from the company you built from the ground up.</p>

<p>I hope that one day, I can look back at my life and say I made an impact, as did Steve Jobs, my personal hero business wise. It doesn&rsquo;t has to be as significant as Steve&rsquo;s impact, but I would like to know that I have done well according to my expectations.</p>

<p>So hereby I salute you, Steve, you are a great man and leader. Take care.</p>
