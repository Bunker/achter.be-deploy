<p>Yesterday I did some live blogging during the presentation, but last night and today I had some time to think about the evening and all the stuff we&rsquo;ve seen. My initial thoughts are, the organisation could have been a bit better. Although the venue was very fine, the little food I got my hands on was good and the goodie bags were awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4657467635/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4657467635_1ccec7c748.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>The presentations could have been less confusing and the quiz afterwards should have been organized better. It was a very nice way of letting us vote, but apparently some of the remotes didn&rsquo;t work, which off course manipulated the results quite a bit. Not that I was harmed by that, I just don&rsquo;t know enough info about movies. Very important I think there should have been a round for questions after every presentation, because a lot of people had questions about the TV&rsquo;s that could have been interesting for all of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4658046626/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1297/4658046626_f92658a20b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>But on the 3D itself now. I&rsquo;m still not convinced about the whole concept of 3D. I don&rsquo;t really like watching a movie in 3D, first of all, it still feels very unreal. The biggest drawback is that in order to experience 3D TV, you still need to wear a pair of glasses, who are btw very expensive.</p>

<p>Imagine following situation: you&rsquo;re coming home after a day of work, you eat something, decide to watch some relaxing television, but wait&#8230;, where did I leave the glasses, I mean I&rsquo;m already having trouble locating the remote control of the TV. Let&rsquo;s say I found them, apparently our cat decided that the glasses were to play with and has left some scratches and bite marks all over it. Well, still not really a problem, let&rsquo;s just try them on, oh wait, they are not charged anymore, because i forgot to put them in the USB charger. By now my relax evening of watching TV has been ruined already. So I decide to ditch the glasses, turn off the TV and get behind the computer to get some more work done. Great</p>

<p>This is fictional, for the moment, but at a certain point this could turn into reality. I don&rsquo;t want that kind of reality. Give me a 2D screen, which I turn on, look for the remote for about a minute and further on I can watch the 50th rerun of &#8220;Allo, Allo&#8221; or something. I find it a pretty stupid concept to try to mimic 3D in film or a serie, because you can&rsquo;t interact with the world that&rsquo;s living around you. So in that perspective I think gaming in 3D has a future, yesterday I played a bit with avatar in 3D and I very much liked it. Because you are in the 3D environment you can better experience the game and interact with it. Although I still think that for a game to be using 3D to the fullest you really need to be in the middle of the game terrain, like it was promised with Virtual Reality.</p>

<p>All in all I had a fun evening, met some nice people, saw the regular crowd again and as usual shot some photos (find more in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157624176827836/" title="Set, Samsung s3dTV">set</a>). But I don&rsquo;t think anyone of the people at the event will buy a television that starts at 1800 euro with only 2 glasses and without a lot of quality content.</p>
