				<p>As I was given the samsung NX10 to test for 10 days, I was also handed a sony nex-5 a couple of weeks ago to play with it for one week. I&rsquo;ve been postponing posting about this camera, because to be honest I didn&rsquo;t really like it. The problem is not that I didn&rsquo;t like the format, the quality or the technical parts of it. Actually I was very excited about those beforehand.</p>

<p>So why did I not like the camera, it wasn&rsquo;t intuitive. I tried to get over it and carried it with me for the whole week. The menu is not very logical, when I got the camera, I popped in a sd-card and wanted to format the card before taking pictures. Too bad it took me over 5 minutes to locate the format option in the menu. Because once you are in the menu, there are several submenu&rsquo;s but the problem is that they are located vertically below each other and the camera stops scrolling for a little bit once you reach the end of the first menu. So you assume you reached the end of the menu and need to continue in another menu.</p>

<p>Next to that I was very annoyed by the startup time, it takes the camera 3-4 seconds to be able to take a picture. That&rsquo;s too long for me. When I turn on a camera I want to be able to use it and not wait and loose the moment.</p>

<p>But the most annoying thing was the fact that once you entered either photo or video mode, you could not review the results of the other mode without going to the unlogical menu.</p>

<p>So overall the camera is very nice, it would have been a great competitor compared to the samsung NX10, but sadly enough I didn&rsquo;t take a lot of pictures because after the first day I got just very annoyed with it. Let&rsquo;s hope sony fixes the each of use for their next release of this camera, it has a lot of potential but I would not recommend the camera to a friend.</p>

				<p>This is a quote from &#8220;The Social Network&#8221;, the movie I was invited to watch yesterday in a screening together with some other bloggers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The social network&#8221; is the film about Marc Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook.com, a site I and probably you use every day. That for starters makes it very weird to watch the movie. I knew a bit about how the story of facebook goes and have to say, it stays very close to what happened in real life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not that big of a film geek, that I know what the director made before and what the main actors are known for, but I can appreciate a good movie and have some attention for how the film is filmed. The first thing I noticed is a very distinctive style of filming and the great use of subtle light. That makes a movie already more interesting for me. Also the fact that I&rsquo;m a geek, helps when the movie is about a geek creating the biggest social network.</p>

<p>The movie was very fastpaced and has two law suits from in the first years of facebook nicely intertwined with the story of how facebook grew from an idea to having 1 billion members. At moments it is a bit too fast to follow, so you&rsquo;ll probably miss a lot of subtle humour. But at other moments the story seemed to drag along, with the biggest anticlimax the launch of thefacebook.com. Just a press on a button and that was it, not even a beer was cracked at that moment. A bit pity but if that&rsquo;s the way it went, although just for the film&rsquo;s sake I would have put it in, anyway.</p>

<p>Although 2 hours is already pretty long for a movie, I found it disappointing that the biggest move facebook ever made, was not included in the film. I mean the film stopped at moving over to the UK universities and reaching there 1 billion members. I would have loved to see how it all grew and why they made the brightest and biggest move facebook could ever make, which was giving up being exclusive and going open to everybody, so that you and I now can be on facebook too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out the feeling that I have after seeing the movie. I liked it, I liked it a lot. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a movie that will be a big hit, because of the niche of people that it will appeal to. I will definitely see it again, when it comes on tv or on dvd, if not only to figure out the feeling I&rsquo;m left with.</p>

<p>Enjoy the trailer and thx <a href="http://www.adhese.com" rel="contact met" title="adhese.com">Adhese</a> for inviting me.</p>

				<p>At the beginning of july I got asked by <a href="http://www.wonderingmick.com/" title="MICK!" rel="contact, met">Mick</a> to join <a href="http://salon8.cktail.com/" title="Salon8" rel="contact, met, muse">Salon 8</a>. Salon 8 is a project where 8 photographers take on 26 themes. Now because they started in January, but somebody quit, they had an open spot, where I could fit in.</p>

<p>I already knew the project, had followed it on the website, so I did not think very long and agreed to take part. My first assignment was already 4 days later, but I managed to photograph and upload in time.</p>

<p>The reason I said yes, is because it is perfect to try out some new ideas and to start with a theme and make a picture around it. Anyway these are my first 3 entries.</p>

				<p>Last month I had the opportunity to play with the Samsung NX10 camera. As said in <a href="http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/" title="Samsung NX10">my previous post</a> I really liked the camera and that didn&rsquo;t change during the 10 days I was allowed to use it. I even wanted to keep the camera with the 20mm pancake lens. Just because it is such an amazing small and convenient camera, it can go anywhere with you and it delivers great results.</p>

<p>I used the NX10 to shoot some behind the scene material during a wedding with <a href="http://www.bertstephani.com">Bert Stephani</a>. The photos are taken with the 20mm pancake lens and as jpeg in monochrome mode. The results are very good and I like the speed, the sharpness and the fast focus it has.</p>

<p>I also tried the NX10 during the &#8220;dijlefeesten&#8221; festival in my hometown and during some other low light conditions. The results are quite exceptional, the noise is very acceptable, that&rsquo;s mainly because of the large sensor, it&rsquo;s actually only a 1.5 crop factor. But not only the noise is very acceptable, the autofocus is also very good and fast even with the lights on stage flooding the frame.</p>

<p>I can keep on talking about the technical stuff of this camera. Samsung had to make some compromises to keep the camera small but the experience with this camera is just great, I mean it just awesome to use, it&rsquo;s small, fast, easy to use, but most of all it&rsquo;s fun to use. Samsung keep up the good work.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775216821/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4775216821_0e4af4b7ff.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a>&lt;/p?</p>

<p>Last wednesday I was invited on the <a href="http://www.sound.philips.com/" title="Obsessed with sound" rel="none">&#8220;Obsessed with sound event of Philips&#8221;</a> in the <a href="http://www.galaxystudios.com/" rel="none" Title="Galaxy studios mol">Galaxy studios</a> in Mol. The purpose of this event is to submerge us in sound with one of their three heroes for the campagne, the producer of the soundtrack of batman begins, Geof Foster.</p>

<p>Bert Van Daele gave us a little history lesson about how Philips has and still is obsessed with sound since the beginning. Their main ideas since the beginning are that sound should be of best possible quality and sound should be available to everyone. Along those lines they created the first affordable radio in the 1920&rsquo;s called &#8220;het kappelke&#8221;</p>

<p>In the 1940&rsquo;s philips introduced the vinyl and created the philigraph. They kept on innovating in the 1950&rsquo;s and they developed the kinetic tape. By the 1960&rsquo;s Philips Hasselt developed the compact cassette and since then it became and still is the main music carrier. In 1968 they developed the cassette in the car. In the 70&rsquo;s they developed the laser disc and they used the mpeg file format for video and audio. But in the 70&rsquo;s the emphasis for Philips was more on video then on sound. In 1982 the audio cd was invented, it gave better quality and far more storage capacity. In the 90&rsquo;s they started with DVD and SACD, where the DVD took of pretty well, the SACD was and still is a niche market. 2004 marked the date of the ambisound release and is another way to create surround sound without all the different speakers. And today we are here to see and hear the 360 sound speakers and systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775870044/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4775870044_5217ae4e09.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>Geof Foster was next up, he is the chief engineer for the batman begins soundtrack. He explained his workflow for making film music.</p>

<p>It all starts with spotting, which is basically putting some existing music against the different scenes. This process ends with a template to direct the composer. The second step is writing the music through the unique sound of the composer. The third part is scoring, this means choosing from the different sound generators like an orchestra. And the last part is a the actual mixing.</p>

<p>Geof gets involved mostly at the scoring stage, to record and create the sound, a big part of the scoring is choosing the layout and venue for the orchestra and the recording. He uses the batman begins soundtrack as an example. The recording is mostly done in separate parts. The very last thing is putting the music against the film and the sound of the movie itself. There is some more fine-tuning and listening if everything is in place.</p>

<p>Geoff also explained why the soundtrack is a little different from the music used in the film. Most music in the film is not always very interesting music wise, so they tweak it a bit for the OST</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775212393/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4775212393_df6b244aaa.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>After that Bert explained what the 360Sound is all about. It&rsquo;s aimed at people that like good sound, but the speaker system has to be stylish. The 360Sound system has a front facing speaker and two speakers on the sides. The speakers on the side are aimed at bouncing of the walls to create a surround sound. The 360Sound is completely developed in Leuven, be.</p>

<p>The last product is the free floating tweeter, where they created a speaker which creates a full 360 degrees sound experience when the speaker is placed in the middle of the room. I like the idea, although the sound is not perfect, it is nice to have a device that sounds ok and it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are in the room.</p>

<p>Philips also released a couple of iPhone/iPod dock speakers, they sound pretty awesome, but I don&rsquo;t think they will take off until the one with the battery is released.</p>

<p>Because the whole event took place in the Galaxy studios in Mol, one of the best recording studios in the world, we were entitled to a tour trough the complex, complete with the a movie from the late 80&rsquo;s filmed during the building of the complex. It was quite impressive to see what they all did to make sure the best sound is recorded.</p>

<p>I liked the event, I liked some of the products, but I&rsquo;m not convinced they will take off with the high prices. I would have loved some more light to photograph the products. But thx [Talking Heads][4] and Philips for the invite and the Philips GoGear, which I will try to review a bitter later.</p>
