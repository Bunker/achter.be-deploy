				<p>After moving from our apartment to a house we vey fast figured out that we had a lot more cleaning to do. Let that be one of our weak spots in the household. So we started thinking about a cleaning lady, but that turned out pretty expensive if you start looking at a longterm solution. So we decided we would buy a robot cleaner to at least vacuum the place every day.</p>

<p>We started looking online for reviews and different types. It turns out there are only 2 different manufacturers of robot cleaners, the one we all know, iRobot with the roomba and Samsung with their navibots. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a great difference between the different manufacturers at first sight. So why did we choose the navibot instead of a roomba.</p>

<p>Our cat looses a lot of very fine hair so we needed a robot that could deal with that problem. After reading a lot of reviews and watching some YouTube videos about the different models, we decided that we needed the roomba pet series or the navibot VCR8855. So we went to the shop to actually see the robots. We didn&rsquo;t find a roomba pet series in the shop, but we could examine the 555 series. After talking to the person responsible for the robot vacuum cleaners at vandenborre, the thing that made us decide is the difference in cleaning. The roombas wander around randomly while the navibot follows a structured path, to clean. So in our opinion the navibot cleans more thorough and more like we humans do. Although the navibot costs 499, euro vs 429 euro for the roomba, but with the navibot you get more accessories, but you&rsquo;ll find that out in the video.</p>

<p>Only time will tell if the navibot works for us, but that is the subject of another post. So now without further ado here is the unboxing video.</p>

				<p>As I was given the samsung NX10 to test for 10 days, I was also handed a sony nex-5 a couple of weeks ago to play with it for one week. I&rsquo;ve been postponing posting about this camera, because to be honest I didn&rsquo;t really like it. The problem is not that I didn&rsquo;t like the format, the quality or the technical parts of it. Actually I was very excited about those beforehand.</p>

<p>So why did I not like the camera, it wasn&rsquo;t intuitive. I tried to get over it and carried it with me for the whole week. The menu is not very logical, when I got the camera, I popped in a sd-card and wanted to format the card before taking pictures. Too bad it took me over 5 minutes to locate the format option in the menu. Because once you are in the menu, there are several submenu&rsquo;s but the problem is that they are located vertically below each other and the camera stops scrolling for a little bit once you reach the end of the first menu. So you assume you reached the end of the menu and need to continue in another menu.</p>

<p>Next to that I was very annoyed by the startup time, it takes the camera 3-4 seconds to be able to take a picture. That&rsquo;s too long for me. When I turn on a camera I want to be able to use it and not wait and loose the moment.</p>

<p>But the most annoying thing was the fact that once you entered either photo or video mode, you could not review the results of the other mode without going to the unlogical menu.</p>

<p>So overall the camera is very nice, it would have been a great competitor compared to the samsung NX10, but sadly enough I didn&rsquo;t take a lot of pictures because after the first day I got just very annoyed with it. Let&rsquo;s hope sony fixes the each of use for their next release of this camera, it has a lot of potential but I would not recommend the camera to a friend.</p>

				<p>This is a quote from &#8220;The Social Network&#8221;, the movie I was invited to watch yesterday in a screening together with some other bloggers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The social network&#8221; is the film about Marc Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook.com, a site I and probably you use every day. That for starters makes it very weird to watch the movie. I knew a bit about how the story of facebook goes and have to say, it stays very close to what happened in real life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not that big of a film geek, that I know what the director made before and what the main actors are known for, but I can appreciate a good movie and have some attention for how the film is filmed. The first thing I noticed is a very distinctive style of filming and the great use of subtle light. That makes a movie already more interesting for me. Also the fact that I&rsquo;m a geek, helps when the movie is about a geek creating the biggest social network.</p>

<p>The movie was very fastpaced and has two law suits from in the first years of facebook nicely intertwined with the story of how facebook grew from an idea to having 1 billion members. At moments it is a bit too fast to follow, so you&rsquo;ll probably miss a lot of subtle humour. But at other moments the story seemed to drag along, with the biggest anticlimax the launch of thefacebook.com. Just a press on a button and that was it, not even a beer was cracked at that moment. A bit pity but if that&rsquo;s the way it went, although just for the film&rsquo;s sake I would have put it in, anyway.</p>

<p>Although 2 hours is already pretty long for a movie, I found it disappointing that the biggest move facebook ever made, was not included in the film. I mean the film stopped at moving over to the UK universities and reaching there 1 billion members. I would have loved to see how it all grew and why they made the brightest and biggest move facebook could ever make, which was giving up being exclusive and going open to everybody, so that you and I now can be on facebook too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out the feeling that I have after seeing the movie. I liked it, I liked it a lot. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a movie that will be a big hit, because of the niche of people that it will appeal to. I will definitely see it again, when it comes on tv or on dvd, if not only to figure out the feeling I&rsquo;m left with.</p>

<p>Enjoy the trailer and thx <a href="http://www.adhese.com" rel="contact met" title="adhese.com">Adhese</a> for inviting me.</p>

				<p>At the beginning of july I got asked by <a href="http://www.wonderingmick.com/" title="MICK!" rel="contact, met">Mick</a> to join <a href="http://salon8.cktail.com/" title="Salon8" rel="contact, met, muse">Salon 8</a>. Salon 8 is a project where 8 photographers take on 26 themes. Now because they started in January, but somebody quit, they had an open spot, where I could fit in.</p>

<p>I already knew the project, had followed it on the website, so I did not think very long and agreed to take part. My first assignment was already 4 days later, but I managed to photograph and upload in time.</p>

<p>The reason I said yes, is because it is perfect to try out some new ideas and to start with a theme and make a picture around it. Anyway these are my first 3 entries.</p>

				<p>Last month I had the opportunity to play with the Samsung NX10 camera. As said in <a href="http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/" title="Samsung NX10">my previous post</a> I really liked the camera and that didn&rsquo;t change during the 10 days I was allowed to use it. I even wanted to keep the camera with the 20mm pancake lens. Just because it is such an amazing small and convenient camera, it can go anywhere with you and it delivers great results.</p>

<p>I used the NX10 to shoot some behind the scene material during a wedding with <a href="http://www.bertstephani.com">Bert Stephani</a>. The photos are taken with the 20mm pancake lens and as jpeg in monochrome mode. The results are very good and I like the speed, the sharpness and the fast focus it has.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791201689/" title="[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4791201689_b7156075c9.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[camera-test] Samsung NX10" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791203085/" title="[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4791203085_ab5304223e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[camera-test] Samsung NX10" /></a></p>

<p>I also tried the NX10 during the &#8220;dijlefeesten&#8221; festival in my hometown and during some other low light conditions. The results are quite exceptional, the noise is very acceptable, that&rsquo;s mainly because of the large sensor, it&rsquo;s actually only a 1.5 crop factor. But not only the noise is very acceptable, the autofocus is also very good and fast even with the lights on stage flooding the frame.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791838302/" title="[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4791838302_4cc8a52c73.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[camera-test] Samsung NX10" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791208367/" title="[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4791208367_978509c572.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[camera-test] Samsung NX10" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4791840000/" title="[camera-test] Samsung NX10 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4791840000_dbb4c00656.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[camera-test] Samsung NX10" /></a></p>

<p>I can keep on talking about the technical stuff of this camera. Samsung had to make some compromises to keep the camera small but the experience with this camera is just great, I mean it just awesome to use, it&rsquo;s small, fast, easy to use, but most of all it&rsquo;s fun to use. Samsung keep up the good work.</p>
