<p>As a huge Apple fanboy, it&rsquo;s a very sad day for me. Steve Jobs just announced his resignation as a CEO of Apple inc. Below you find the most significant part from his resignation letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><em>Steve Jobs &#8211; Resignation Letter august 24, 2011</em></small></p>

<p>We all know that Steve&rsquo;s health was on a bad streak, starting with his pancreas cancer in 2006, his liver transplant in 2009 and the indefinite leave of absence due to health issues. Every keynote we saw a sleeker and sleeker Steve at this rate, he would be no more than a skeleton by the release of the iPhone 6. But I hoped that Steve would recover and kick some more butt in the years to come. Sadly that won&rsquo;t be true anymore. Let&rsquo;s just hope, that Steve can now focus on his health a bit more.</p>

<p>Why do I say, the end of an era? A look at his track record, which reads like a good novel and is a string of successes, says it all. The story starts in 1976 with the release of the Apple I, a computer built in a garage by 2 very young guys, dreaming that one day they could earn a profit from it. Little would they know that was the beginning of a dream come true. Although Wozniak left Apple and Jobs was fired in the nineties and hired back afterwards, in which time he founded, build and make Pixar huge. Now Apple not only has produced great products, but it has also become the biggest company in the world.</p>

<p>With Jobs now resigning as CEO I still believe in Apple and they will keep on producing great products, but there won&rsquo;t be anymore iconic black turtle necks, no more casual &#8220;There&rsquo;s one more thing&#8221; to drop a bomb on a market. I fear that the cult of mac, will no longer exist, it has lost it leader. Apple will probably become a dull company that still makes great products, but doesn&rsquo;t have me sitting in suspense during a keynote what they will announce.</p>

<p>Off course Jobs is not without fault, I&rsquo;m the first to admit it, but he is kind of a hero for me. Creating a company from scratch and making it this big, but still maintaining the suspense when announcing something new. There is no other company that I know of where one man had such an impact on the development, announcement and sales of a product that nobody needed before it was announced. It also takes a great man, to resign due to health reasons from the company you built from the ground up.</p>

<p>I hope that one day, I can look back at my life and say I made an impact, as did Steve Jobs, my personal hero business wise. It doesn&rsquo;t has to be as significant as Steve&rsquo;s impact, but I would like to know that I have done well according to my expectations.</p>

<p>So hereby I salute you, Steve, you are a great man and leader. Take care.</p>

<p>Yesterday a pretty serious thunderstorm passed over Belgium. I setup my tripod in the bedroom and tried to shoot some lighting. I got one shot that worked out great. This one&#8230;</p>

<p>Last year when <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="Saravdv, there are no endings only new beginnings" rel="muse met">Saravdv</a> and I went to Paris for the iPad launch at the louvre Apple store, we were asked if we could be filmed for a possible promo film for Apple. As we got some iTunes gift cards in exchange, we did agree.</p>

<p>Since then we did not hear anything about it anymore, until last night when I watched the keynote, to my surprise I could see sara and myself during the video of &#8220;2010: the year of the iPad.&#8221; as I&rsquo;m a very big applefanboy, I&rsquo;m quite proud to be in the video that his Steveness showed during a keynote. If you want to check it out, watch the keynote at <a href="http://bit.ly/fv9o83">Apple event website</a>. You can see us very briefly at 9:49 min in the keynote.</p>

<p>Update, you can also watch the video of &#8220;iPad: Year One&#8221; on Apple&rsquo;s YouTube channel. I have embedded the video also here, you can see Sara and me at 0:35min.</p>

				<p>After more than 2 months using the Navibot, I want to give you a review. Let me say, we&rsquo;re pretty pleased with the Robot vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a total solution for cleaning, it does a very good job keeping the house clean, when you set it on a daily routine. It takes a structured path, which takes it through the most part of the room. During it&rsquo;s path, it tries to cover the whole area, but misses some spots. Luckily it doesn&rsquo;t take the same path everyday and does the missed spots the next day.</p>

<p>Once a week we empty the container containing the dust and hairs,. So it doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of maintanance but whenever you forget about putting away all toys for the cat or the floorcloths, we use as doormats, something is bound to get stuck in the rotating brushes. Then the robot stops and starts beeping, until you fix the problem, that&rsquo;s annoying and drives our cat crazy when we aren&rsquo;t at home. But apart from that, it doesn&rsquo;t get trapped under furniture, it doesn&rsquo;t wrecks anything around the home. It only bumps into the furniture that has legs that are smaller than 5cm because it is in the blind spot of the sensors. Even when it does bump into your furniture, it doesn&rsquo;t really damages it, because of the rubber bumpers.</p>

<p>The only very annoying thing about the robot is whenever you use the guards, it gets confused because the beam of the guard spreads wider then you intend and that leaves areas around the guard without cleaning. Our robot also had a little defect, which broke the system that makes the back brush rotate and we had to send it in for repair. Since then it drives around and cleans the whole area very good.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a decent robot vacuum cleaner, then this is definitely what you need. It does a really good job keeping the house clean, without you lifting a finger, it&rsquo;s definitely not perfect but it&rsquo;s a great aid. For us it is a great tool and definitely cheaper than paying a cleaning lady. So yes, it&rsquo;s an expensive buy, but it will pay off after a while, because maintenance is not expensive at all. Even after 2 months we didn&rsquo;t have to change any of the brushes.</p>

				<p>Last week I received the Garmin Forerunner 210 I ordered of <a href="http://garmin.mijngpsshop.be" title="Mijn gpsshop">mijngpsshop.be</a>. I made an unboxing movie, which you can see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/17244907">Unboxing Garmin Forerunner 210</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/pitslamp">PitsLamp</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>I already trained twice with the forerunner 210 and it behaved as advertised, except for 1 thing. It does not calculate the calories I burn during the training. But after searching on the internet I found a solution for that. You have to hard reset the watch, because there is something wrong when you receive it from the factory, which makes that the user settings aren&rsquo;t used during the training.</p>

<p>The hard reset procedure you need to perform is pressing the page/menu and lap/reset at the same time, and holding them until you see a prompt (about 3 seconds). This clears all data on the watch, it also clears your history so be aware that you upload the data first, before doing this reset.</p>
