				<p>I have had some crazy ideas before and I&rsquo;ve build quite a reputation of opening shops of my favourite brands and queueing for gadgets. When, last January I saw Steve jobs unveil the iPad, I was sold. I also knew I would be queueing for it when it became available in Europe.</p>

<p>So today was the day of the official release for the iPad In France. in the past days I have been researching a lot about the release on the internet. Well actually I was researching it with <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend collegue met" title="Pieter Van Impe">Pieter</a>, we first thought of going to the fnac in Lille. It turned we could be left without an iPad to buy, so we decided to go to Paris.</p>

<p>Tonight at midnight we left for Paris accompanied by <a href="http://www.saravdv.be">Sara</a> and [Davy][2]. We arrived at 3h30 and found a parking spot surprisingly easy just around the corner of the apple store. There were already 6 people in front of us, but at least we knew we would have an iPad and so the waiting began.</p>

<p>When the hour got closer, Pieter and I were wondering about which one we would get, while Sara was deciding if she would get one. Unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t have all the time waiting to decide because the press found out that there were some crazy Belgians in the queue. Most of them wanted to talk to us. We gave some interviews and were asked by a production crew of Apple to be followed while and after buying the iPad. We even got an iTunes gift certificate of 15â‚¬ out of it.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found all the links to the videos and articles yet but I&rsquo;ll add them once I&rsquo;ve found them.&lt;/&gt;</p>

<p>This post is typed on the iPad and I found it pretty pleasing to type a small blogpost like this one in the WP app. After playing with it for the last hour I&rsquo;m even more convinced that I wanted this device. I&rsquo;ll write a review and some app recommendations later aft i used it for an extended time.</p>

				<p>Photographing with the vredebox made me realize that I wanted to experience more of analog photography. So I started searching online for a more advanced camera. The vredebox is great, but you&rsquo;re so limited to what you can photograph with it and how. So I wanted so more control over depth of field, shutterspeed and aperture. My search let me towards the Twin Lens Reflex camera&rsquo;s. Although these camera&rsquo;s are pretty old, you still pay a good amount of money for them. I mean a mamiya or yashica changes owner for about 300 euro on ebay.</p>

<p>On <a href="hhttp://www.2dehands.be/foto-camera/" title="Foto en camera op 2dehands.be" rel="none">2dehands.be</a> I found after a lot of searching a original Rolleiflex Standard 622 from 1934 for 50 euro. I went to check it out, although it misses the plate with the serial number, everything else is in great shape. I went with it.</p>

<p>The Rolleiflex original standard model was made by Franke &amp; Heidecke in Braunschweig, Germany from 1932 to 1938. The lens is a 75mm f3.5 uncoated carl zeis lens, the shutter goes from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub> till 1 second. And off course there is a bulb mode. Apparently famous war photographer and Magnum co-founder Robert Capa used this camera during WW II, next to a contax camera.</p>

<p>I tried some different film with it, at the moment I haven&rsquo;t figured out which one I prefer but what I do know is, that this is an awsome camera. Just look at some of the results.</p>

				<p>When my grandparents died last year, my family and I had to clean out their house. I knew they had a very old camera on their chimney but I didn&rsquo;t know if it still worked. To my big surprise everything worked great, although it all could use a little cleaning.</p>

<p>I started researching the camera on the internet and found that it&rsquo;s a vredebox made by a German company called vredeborch in Friedeburg. The camera uses 120 film, has a meniscus lens with an aperture of f11. Fastest shutterspeed is 1/30th of a second. There are 3 levers on the side, one for stopping down the lens to f16 and the other 2 to use the bulb setting.</p>

<p>Those settings are a bit of a let down, but I wanted to test it out anyway. So after <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend met" title="Pieter Van Impe">Pieter</a> gave me a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 pro, I started shooting with the vredebox.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, just so you know, the minimum focus distance on this camera is 3 meters.</p>

<p>Let me first post some results and then I&rsquo;ll give a little review about the camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569687736/" title="[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3437/4569687736_dc9f8bb24e.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral" /></a><br />
This picture was taken on Ilford Delta 400 pro film.</p>

Taken on Ilford Delta 3200&lt;/p?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569684332/" title="[vredebox] Hotel VÃ© by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3498/4569684332_708d164f30.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="[vredebox] Hotel VÃ©" /></a><br />
Taken on Ilford Delta 100 film</p>

<p>If you want to follow my progress with the vredebox, I suggest you follow this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157623847114053/" rel="me" title="[Film] Vredebox on flickr.com">set on flickr</a>, I&rsquo;ll post the results there when available.</p>

<p>Now for a short review of the camera. Although it&rsquo;s technically not very good, I really like the box feeling and the way of taking pictures. Because of the lack of features or wide range of aperture and shutterspeed, I think a lot more before I make I picture. This makes that I&rsquo;m more concentrating on the framing of the shot, which is not easy in the small viewfinder located at your stomach.</p>

<p>Until now I&rsquo;m very pleased with the results of the box, a camera that&rsquo;s at least 60 year old. It&rsquo;s a decent and fun camera for hobby projects, so I&rsquo;ll be playing with it a lot more in the future</p>

				<p>Last night <a title="Canvas" rel="none" href="http://www.canvas.be/">Canvas</a> aired the third episode of <a title="BBC" rel="none" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>&#8216;s internet documentary <a title="Virtual Revolution" rel="none" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution">The Virtual Revolution</a>. The virtual revolution was an an open and collaborative production, which encouraged the web audience to help shape the series. But not only that is what made the experience interactive, during the TV-show people were encouraged to tweet and start a discussion about the subject of that evening. Canvas does the same and even has a web only discussion panel after every episode. Although hugely interesting, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about it, you can check it out yourself at the <a title="The Virtual Revolution on Canvas" rel="none" href="http://programmas.canvas.be/the-virtual-revolution/">Canvas-website</a> or on twitter with the hashtag <a title="#virtualrevolution on Canvas" rel="none" href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23virtualrevolution">#virtualrevolution</a></p>

<p>While following the tweets I noticed that a lot of people are very naive about their data online. They seem to think that you can hide yourself forever behind a screenname and that facebook is evil, because of their privacy settings. Although I don&rsquo;t always agree with the policy of facebook, you won&rsquo;t hear me say that they are the only evil on today&rsquo;s web.</p>

<p>At a certain point in the discussion someone, whom I&rsquo;m not going to name, said, I don&rsquo;t use my name on the web, so it will be very difficult to find out who I am. To prove that it&rsquo;s definitely not only facebook that has a lot of data about you, I started by looking to the person&rsquo;s twitter account, there was a .be domain listed, I looked at the registry data for the domain. I found out a name but not yet the one I needed. By coupling that name to his nickname in google, I found within 7 minutes his real name, location, profession, likes and marriage status. This all without the use of facebook.</p>

<p>I think, most people don&rsquo;t realize what they are sharing and how easy it is to find that data. From the moment you are connected to the internet you are sharing a lot of information. You get personalized ads according to your search query, content of your mail, webpage you are visiting, location you are, &#8230; Everything you do on the web is recorded somewhere, somehow. Not only on the web btw, just think what&rsquo;s possible with fidelity cards or your bank card.</p>

				<p>On the evening of Easter I found myself with some spare time. An idea started to form in my head, just for fun I wanted to recreate a movie poster. After a <a href="http://twitter.com/Bunker/status/11601861573" rel="me" title="Bunker at twitter">tweet</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">@DeFre</a> became my instant model.</p>

<p>This left me just one hour to find a poster I wanted, think about how I would achieve the same look and prepare everything. I found this movie poster:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/upload/crank2high.jpg" alt="Movie Poster for Crank 2 High Voltage" /></p>

<p>because I knew <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">FrÃ©</a> already, I was pretty sure it would work.</p>

<p>After some tweaking in post processing and the addition of artificial smoke, because I couldn&rsquo;t gather enough smokers on a short notice, here is the result</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4539647013/" title="[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4539647013_541751701b.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment" /></a></p>

<p>The shoot was done in a total of 4 hours from idea till final image. I used 2 bowens gemini 500R studiolights with a bowens travelpak. The photo was taken in 20sec exposure while manually triggering the flashes 3 times.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the result but it&rsquo;s a start. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot while doing this and most importantly we all had a lot of fun. Big thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">FrÃ©</a> to go along with my crazy idea and <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" rel="sweetheart co-resident friend" title="Sara Van de Velde">Sara</a> for helping out, withstanding the cold and being the beer supplier of the evening.</p>
