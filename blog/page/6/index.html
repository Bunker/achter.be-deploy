				<p>Last thursday samsung gave me a nx10 camera to play with for 10 days. The camera is something in between a micro four thirds and a entry level dslr.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on giving you a full technical test of this camera, for such a review I&rsquo;ll point you towards [dpreview][1], who did an in depth review of the specs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write a more once I have tested and worked with the camera for ten days. Right now I&rsquo;m going to write down my first impressions.</p>

<p>The camera is very lightweight, fast, easy to handle and produces pictures of astonishing quality for such a small camera. Because it works with the same size chip as the entry level dslr&rsquo;s, the higher iso are acceptable in the tests I did so far.</p>

<p>Although I love most of the camera there are a couple things that need some work in my opinion. The real drawback is the electronic viewfinder. I understand they had to drop the optical viewfinder for an digital one to keep the body very small and lightweight. What I don&rsquo;t get is that the viewfinder&rsquo;s image quality is pretty bad. For sure if you compare it to the LCD on the back.</p>

<p>The second thing i don&rsquo;t like is the manual focus. First you either have to select it on camera or on the lens depending on which lens you have mounted. That&rsquo;s confusing and I don&rsquo;t like it. Second the the viewfinder zooms to help you focus, but the zoom is just showing you the same info in 4 pixels as before in one pixel. This makes it very hard to focus because what you see is all the time a bit unsharp.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m complaining about the manual focus I can only be amazed by how accurate and fast the autofocus is. It uses the contrast to focus which makes it hard to focus on a rather shallow contrast scene, but for any other circumstance it works wonders.</p>

<p>The 30mm f2 pancake lens is awesome but the kitlens (18-55mm) as with most entry level dslr&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t very good. Although the image quality is pretty ok for a standard low quality lens what disturbs me is it&rsquo;s size. The whole camera is build to being small and portable. With the kitlens the camera becomes bulky.</p>

<p>The pancake lenses are just great because of there compact size. Although at the moment you can only buy the 30mm f2, my contacts at Samsung Belgium have assured me that before the end of the year there will be a wider range of lenses available.</p>

<p>I said it would be a short review but it turned out to be an almost full review. I&rsquo;m going to take some more photographs with the camera now and will include some in the next post.</p>

				<p>Today I&rsquo;ve used my iPad for 12 days and I love it even more then I did the first day.</p>

<p>I love catching up with my RSS feeds, reading and replying to e-mails, writing blogposts and booking a hotel. The size of the screen makes it a great device for presenting pictures and watching series or movies streamed from my MBP.</p>

<p>Typing on the ipad is actually pretty good, you can&rsquo;t use your regular typing position but typing with 6 fingers works very well. It&rsquo;s just an awesome device to use all the time and everywhere.</p>

<p>But there are a few small things that annoy me. First of all Apple should have included some way to prop up the iPad when resting it in your lap or putting it on the table to type with 2 hands. Now I&rsquo;m always looking for a way to elevate it a bit and most of the time I&rsquo;m putting my wallet under it, because that&rsquo;s the perfect height and doesn&rsquo;t slip. But at the moment I did not find any great case yet. I would love the <a href="http://www.dodocase.com">DODO case</a> but they are backordered for 4 to 6 weeks and they are missing a nice height for watching movies</p>

<p>Another annoying thing is that at the moment there is no Twitter client that I like and definitely no app that satisfies my needs for google reader, but off course there&rsquo;s an app for that at least over time there will.</p>

<p>But the most annoying thing is taking it out of your bag in Belgium. once you take it out to usef it, there&rsquo;s always somebody who starts saying that there are better things to use, you can&rsquo;t do this or that,&#8230; Basically I like my iPad, it serves the purpose where I bought it for, so just let me use it and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m taking it out to brag, I just want to use it.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to stop this blogpost so I can watch [chase jarvis live][2]</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4657447871/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4657447871_4b8eb83963.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday I did some live blogging during the presentation, but last night and today I had some time to think about the evening and all the stuff we&rsquo;ve seen. My initial thoughts are, the organisation could have been a bit better. Although the venue was very fine, the little food I got my hands on was good and the goodie bags were awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4657467635/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4657467635_1ccec7c748.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>The presentations could have been less confusing and the quiz afterwards should have been organized better. It was a very nice way of letting us vote, but apparently some of the remotes didn&rsquo;t work, which off course manipulated the results quite a bit. Not that I was harmed by that, I just don&rsquo;t know enough info about movies. Very important I think there should have been a round for questions after every presentation, because a lot of people had questions about the TV&rsquo;s that could have been interesting for all of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4658046626/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1297/4658046626_f92658a20b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>But on the 3D itself now. I&rsquo;m still not convinced about the whole concept of 3D. I don&rsquo;t really like watching a movie in 3D, first of all, it still feels very unreal. The biggest drawback is that in order to experience 3D TV, you still need to wear a pair of glasses, who are btw very expensive.</p>

<p>Imagine following situation: you&rsquo;re coming home after a day of work, you eat something, decide to watch some relaxing television, but wait&#8230;, where did I leave the glasses, I mean I&rsquo;m already having trouble locating the remote control of the TV. Let&rsquo;s say I found them, apparently our cat decided that the glasses were to play with and has left some scratches and bite marks all over it. Well, still not really a problem, let&rsquo;s just try them on, oh wait, they are not charged anymore, because i forgot to put them in the USB charger. By now my relax evening of watching TV has been ruined already. So I decide to ditch the glasses, turn off the TV and get behind the computer to get some more work done. Great</p>

<p>This is fictional, for the moment, but at a certain point this could turn into reality. I don&rsquo;t want that kind of reality. Give me a 2D screen, which I turn on, look for the remote for about a minute and further on I can watch the 50th rerun of &#8220;Allo, Allo&#8221; or something. I find it a pretty stupid concept to try to mimic 3D in film or a serie, because you can&rsquo;t interact with the world that&rsquo;s living around you. So in that perspective I think gaming in 3D has a future, yesterday I played a bit with avatar in 3D and I very much liked it. Because you are in the 3D environment you can better experience the game and interact with it. Although I still think that for a game to be using 3D to the fullest you really need to be in the middle of the game terrain, like it was promised with Virtual Reality.</p>

<p>All in all I had a fun evening, met some nice people, saw the regular crowd again and as usual shot some photos (find more in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157624176827836/" title="Set, Samsung s3dTV">set</a>). But I don&rsquo;t think anyone of the people at the event will buy a television that starts at 1800 euro with only 2 glasses and without a lot of quality content.</p>

				<p>Today I&rsquo;m invited at the launch of the 3D tv in Brussels. I&rsquo;m live blogging from the event.</p>

<p>To start we have Bruno Tassert, product manager at Samsung. He&rsquo;s giving a product overview of the 3D collection of Samsung. It started in the eighties but with the clumsy glasses in cardboard it was not a real success. Until the film avatar last year 3D stayed without success. Today 3D is possible because the technology permits it. The movie studios have adopted the technology and now it&rsquo;s time for the consumer to use 3D in their own homes.</p>

<p>3D is basically two images who are projected next to each other. At first in 2 different colors but now the technology has evolved and uses different polarities in the glasses, this is the way it is used by the movie theaters, it&rsquo;s passive. The tech used in the in the samsung tv is with an active component in the glasses. One side is just shown on TV the other one is shown and filtered by the glasses. This technology uses 200mhz. This is called the shutter technique. The last way is like the photos in 3D which has the big disadvantage that you can&rsquo;t look at it from a side and the 2D experience really sucks. Although they all have their disadvantages, the shutter technique is the only one that makes it possible to show HD content.</p>

<p>As you would expect you can put the 2 different images side by side or on top of each other. Now we are getting in to the really technical stuff, so I&rsquo;m just going to skip that part if you want more info about it, you can search for it yourself on the Internet.</p>

<p>You have to choose for Samsung, according to them because they launched 3D as first and have all the other devices ready for it. But the most important reason is because they use conversion by object based depth processing, while the other ways of 3D just separate the objects in a vertical direction.</p>

<p>For 3D you only need a television, a blue Ray player and off course the glasses. There are 3 different types at the moment, ranging from 2000 to 5000+ euro for the LCD and LED. But they also have plasma. Next to that they also have the blue Ray player and the 3D home cinema. The glasses range from 79 euro for the children glasses and going up to 99 euro for the adult version. There are 2 sizes in adult sizes, because not everybody has the same face.</p>

<p>The content is available from movies, games like avatar which we can test here and there are a couple of channels that start their emissions in 3D</p>

<p>Now we arrive at the real history of 3D, in 1857 the first real 3D machine was build, in the 1950&rsquo;s there were already about 60 movies released in 3D, but it was a real PITA to watch a full length movie. In the sixties they tried some 3D in color but it still didn&rsquo;t work, after another try with Jaws they left the idea for a while. The first real 3D were the Imax movies in theme parks. That worked but it was very expensive and time consuming to make Imax movies. We had to wait till this century before they started to do some new things in 3D, where they started again with animation films and the real breakthrough was reached last summer with the release of several 3D movies.</p>

<p>Now we get a overview of what they showed in the Belgian pavilion</p>

<p>In 2005 they 5 biggest directors in Hollywood announced at DLP that 3D would be the future for the movies because that way it was almost impossible to pirate. Philips started with a project for 3D without glasses but had to stop production because it was too heavy, big and there was not enough quality.</p>

<p>There are apparently 2 different ways of filming, one is crossing the cameras, that&rsquo;s what is used by Cameron in Avatar. The other way is, like it&rsquo;s mainly used in Europe is by aligning the cameras parrallel which makes the images pop more. But on infinity it everything is in focus.</p>

<p>Now we have something to eat and will all participate in a quiz later on. My opinion on the whole experience I&rsquo;ll post later with some pictures. Stay tuned.</p>
