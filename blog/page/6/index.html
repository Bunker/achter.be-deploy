				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775216821/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4775216821_0e4af4b7ff.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a>&lt;/p?</p>

<p>Last wednesday I was invited on the <a href="http://www.sound.philips.com/" title="Obsessed with sound" rel="none">&#8220;Obsessed with sound event of Philips&#8221;</a> in the <a href="http://www.galaxystudios.com/" rel="none" Title="Galaxy studios mol">Galaxy studios</a> in Mol. The purpose of this event is to submerge us in sound with one of their three heroes for the campagne, the producer of the soundtrack of batman begins, Geof Foster.</p>

<p>Bert Van Daele gave us a little history lesson about how Philips has and still is obsessed with sound since the beginning. Their main ideas since the beginning are that sound should be of best possible quality and sound should be available to everyone. Along those lines they created the first affordable radio in the 1920&rsquo;s called &#8220;het kappelke&#8221;</p>

<p>In the 1940&rsquo;s philips introduced the vinyl and created the philigraph. They kept on innovating in the 1950&rsquo;s and they developed the kinetic tape. By the 1960&rsquo;s Philips Hasselt developed the compact cassette and since then it became and still is the main music carrier. In 1968 they developed the cassette in the car. In the 70&rsquo;s they developed the laser disc and they used the mpeg file format for video and audio. But in the 70&rsquo;s the emphasis for Philips was more on video then on sound. In 1982 the audio cd was invented, it gave better quality and far more storage capacity. In the 90&rsquo;s they started with DVD and SACD, where the DVD took of pretty well, the SACD was and still is a niche market. 2004 marked the date of the ambisound release and is another way to create surround sound without all the different speakers. And today we are here to see and hear the 360 sound speakers and systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775870044/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4775870044_5217ae4e09.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>Geof Foster was next up, he is the chief engineer for the batman begins soundtrack. He explained his workflow for making film music.</p>

<p>It all starts with spotting, which is basically putting some existing music against the different scenes. This process ends with a template to direct the composer. The second step is writing the music through the unique sound of the composer. The third part is scoring, this means choosing from the different sound generators like an orchestra. And the last part is a the actual mixing.</p>

<p>Geof gets involved mostly at the scoring stage, to record and create the sound, a big part of the scoring is choosing the layout and venue for the orchestra and the recording. He uses the batman begins soundtrack as an example. The recording is mostly done in separate parts. The very last thing is putting the music against the film and the sound of the movie itself. There is some more fine-tuning and listening if everything is in place.</p>

<p>Geoff also explained why the soundtrack is a little different from the music used in the film. Most music in the film is not always very interesting music wise, so they tweak it a bit for the OST</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775212393/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4775212393_df6b244aaa.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>After that Bert explained what the 360Sound is all about. It&rsquo;s aimed at people that like good sound, but the speaker system has to be stylish. The 360Sound system has a front facing speaker and two speakers on the sides. The speakers on the side are aimed at bouncing of the walls to create a surround sound. The 360Sound is completely developed in Leuven, be.</p>

<p>The last product is the free floating tweeter, where they created a speaker which creates a full 360 degrees sound experience when the speaker is placed in the middle of the room. I like the idea, although the sound is not perfect, it is nice to have a device that sounds ok and it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are in the room.</p>

<p>Philips also released a couple of iPhone/iPod dock speakers, they sound pretty awesome, but I don&rsquo;t think they will take off until the one with the battery is released.</p>

<p>Because the whole event took place in the Galaxy studios in Mol, one of the best recording studios in the world, we were entitled to a tour trough the complex, complete with the a movie from the late 80&rsquo;s filmed during the building of the complex. It was quite impressive to see what they all did to make sure the best sound is recorded.</p>

<p>I liked the event, I liked some of the products, but I&rsquo;m not convinced they will take off with the high prices. I would have loved some more light to photograph the products. But thx [Talking Heads][4] and Philips for the invite and the Philips GoGear, which I will try to review a bitter later.</p>

				<p>Last thursday samsung gave me a nx10 camera to play with for 10 days. The camera is something in between a micro four thirds and a entry level dslr.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on giving you a full technical test of this camera, for such a review I&rsquo;ll point you towards [dpreview][1], who did an in depth review of the specs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write a more once I have tested and worked with the camera for ten days. Right now I&rsquo;m going to write down my first impressions.</p>

<p>The camera is very lightweight, fast, easy to handle and produces pictures of astonishing quality for such a small camera. Because it works with the same size chip as the entry level dslr&rsquo;s, the higher iso are acceptable in the tests I did so far.</p>

<p>Although I love most of the camera there are a couple things that need some work in my opinion. The real drawback is the electronic viewfinder. I understand they had to drop the optical viewfinder for an digital one to keep the body very small and lightweight. What I don&rsquo;t get is that the viewfinder&rsquo;s image quality is pretty bad. For sure if you compare it to the LCD on the back.</p>

<p>The second thing i don&rsquo;t like is the manual focus. First you either have to select it on camera or on the lens depending on which lens you have mounted. That&rsquo;s confusing and I don&rsquo;t like it. Second the the viewfinder zooms to help you focus, but the zoom is just showing you the same info in 4 pixels as before in one pixel. This makes it very hard to focus because what you see is all the time a bit unsharp.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m complaining about the manual focus I can only be amazed by how accurate and fast the autofocus is. It uses the contrast to focus which makes it hard to focus on a rather shallow contrast scene, but for any other circumstance it works wonders.</p>

<p>The 30mm f2 pancake lens is awesome but the kitlens (18-55mm) as with most entry level dslr&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t very good. Although the image quality is pretty ok for a standard low quality lens what disturbs me is it&rsquo;s size. The whole camera is build to being small and portable. With the kitlens the camera becomes bulky.</p>

<p>The pancake lenses are just great because of there compact size. Although at the moment you can only buy the 30mm f2, my contacts at Samsung Belgium have assured me that before the end of the year there will be a wider range of lenses available.</p>

<p>I said it would be a short review but it turned out to be an almost full review. I&rsquo;m going to take some more photographs with the camera now and will include some in the next post.</p>

				<p>Today I&rsquo;ve used my iPad for 12 days and I love it even more then I did the first day.</p>

<p>I love catching up with my RSS feeds, reading and replying to e-mails, writing blogposts and booking a hotel. The size of the screen makes it a great device for presenting pictures and watching series or movies streamed from my MBP.</p>

<p>Typing on the ipad is actually pretty good, you can&rsquo;t use your regular typing position but typing with 6 fingers works very well. It&rsquo;s just an awesome device to use all the time and everywhere.</p>

<p>But there are a few small things that annoy me. First of all Apple should have included some way to prop up the iPad when resting it in your lap or putting it on the table to type with 2 hands. Now I&rsquo;m always looking for a way to elevate it a bit and most of the time I&rsquo;m putting my wallet under it, because that&rsquo;s the perfect height and doesn&rsquo;t slip. But at the moment I did not find any great case yet. I would love the <a href="http://www.dodocase.com">DODO case</a> but they are backordered for 4 to 6 weeks and they are missing a nice height for watching movies</p>

<p>Another annoying thing is that at the moment there is no Twitter client that I like and definitely no app that satisfies my needs for google reader, but off course there&rsquo;s an app for that at least over time there will.</p>

<p>But the most annoying thing is taking it out of your bag in Belgium. once you take it out to usef it, there&rsquo;s always somebody who starts saying that there are better things to use, you can&rsquo;t do this or that,&#8230; Basically I like my iPad, it serves the purpose where I bought it for, so just let me use it and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m taking it out to brag, I just want to use it.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to stop this blogpost so I can watch [chase jarvis live][2]</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4657447871/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4657447871_4b8eb83963.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday I did some live blogging during the presentation, but last night and today I had some time to think about the evening and all the stuff we&rsquo;ve seen. My initial thoughts are, the organisation could have been a bit better. Although the venue was very fine, the little food I got my hands on was good and the goodie bags were awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4657467635/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4657467635_1ccec7c748.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>The presentations could have been less confusing and the quiz afterwards should have been organized better. It was a very nice way of letting us vote, but apparently some of the remotes didn&rsquo;t work, which off course manipulated the results quite a bit. Not that I was harmed by that, I just don&rsquo;t know enough info about movies. Very important I think there should have been a round for questions after every presentation, because a lot of people had questions about the TV&rsquo;s that could have been interesting for all of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4658046626/" title="[event] Samsung 3D TV by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1297/4658046626_f92658a20b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[event] Samsung 3D TV" /></a></p>

<p>But on the 3D itself now. I&rsquo;m still not convinced about the whole concept of 3D. I don&rsquo;t really like watching a movie in 3D, first of all, it still feels very unreal. The biggest drawback is that in order to experience 3D TV, you still need to wear a pair of glasses, who are btw very expensive.</p>

<p>Imagine following situation: you&rsquo;re coming home after a day of work, you eat something, decide to watch some relaxing television, but wait&#8230;, where did I leave the glasses, I mean I&rsquo;m already having trouble locating the remote control of the TV. Let&rsquo;s say I found them, apparently our cat decided that the glasses were to play with and has left some scratches and bite marks all over it. Well, still not really a problem, let&rsquo;s just try them on, oh wait, they are not charged anymore, because i forgot to put them in the USB charger. By now my relax evening of watching TV has been ruined already. So I decide to ditch the glasses, turn off the TV and get behind the computer to get some more work done. Great</p>

<p>This is fictional, for the moment, but at a certain point this could turn into reality. I don&rsquo;t want that kind of reality. Give me a 2D screen, which I turn on, look for the remote for about a minute and further on I can watch the 50th rerun of &#8220;Allo, Allo&#8221; or something. I find it a pretty stupid concept to try to mimic 3D in film or a serie, because you can&rsquo;t interact with the world that&rsquo;s living around you. So in that perspective I think gaming in 3D has a future, yesterday I played a bit with avatar in 3D and I very much liked it. Because you are in the 3D environment you can better experience the game and interact with it. Although I still think that for a game to be using 3D to the fullest you really need to be in the middle of the game terrain, like it was promised with Virtual Reality.</p>

<p>All in all I had a fun evening, met some nice people, saw the regular crowd again and as usual shot some photos (find more in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157624176827836/" title="Set, Samsung s3dTV">set</a>). But I don&rsquo;t think anyone of the people at the event will buy a television that starts at 1800 euro with only 2 glasses and without a lot of quality content.</p>
