      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6815151696/&#34; title=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Sunrise in the mist by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7056/6815151696_ddc8e7af7d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;332&#34; alt=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Sunrise in the mist&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony is really good at letting me test their new cameras. A little while ago I had the chance to test the Sony nex-5n, the successor of the nex-5. I had the pleasure of photographing with the nex-5, which I reviewed over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/&#34; title=&#34;Sony Nex-5, hands-on Review&#34; rel=&#34;me&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As I said then, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the menus, the startup time, &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5n is a whole different deal, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s a great camera. Sony really listened to their users, they did a real good job cleaning up the menu-interface. It feels snappy, intuitive and very logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6815149410/&#34; title=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] NOTP by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6815149410_1aaa5d034e.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] NOTP&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the photos is great, it can match the quality of my 5d MK II, which is about 1500 euro more expensive. The photo above is a shot of a concert at 3200 iso, with the standard jpg b/w conversion on it. There is almost no noise and the image is pretty sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6961267217/&#34; title=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Spa-Francorchamps by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6961267217_844a8bc86d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;332&#34; alt=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Spa-Francorchamps&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other concern about the nex-5 was the that the camera was pretty slow, well the 5n is definitely not slow. It has a fast autofocus, pretty short start up time, but when you can capture a race-car in full focus on a track, I can only say that it&amp;rsquo;s really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6815150124/&#34; title=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Me by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6815150124_ebb4faab7d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;332&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;[Sony nex-5n] Me&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as with every camera, there are a couple of drawbacks, the first being that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a viewfinder, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty annoying when photographing in bright light. Sony kinda solved this problem by adding a swiveling screen, a very sturdy one I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the fact that the flash is external, an sich not a real problem, except sony doens&amp;rsquo;t like standard hotshoes. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even include the typical sony hotshoe, so the only way you can use a flash is by using the included small flash, a flash I don&amp;rsquo;t like. It&amp;rsquo;s small, there are almost no way to control it and it feels pretty filmsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most annoying thing, but that&amp;rsquo;s something I have found in all Sony cameras is the way, you can review your photos and videos on it. I can imagine some people find it very good, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the menu to view everything I have on my card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the few things I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that much, the nex-5n is a very decent camera. Even so good that my girlfriend and I are actually considering buying one, how&amp;rsquo;s that for a reference. I test a lot of mirrorless cameras and this is the first I really think is up to par with all DSLR&amp;rsquo;s in the same or even a bit higher price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thx to my girlfriend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saravdv.be&#34; title=&#34;There are no endings, only new beginnings&#34; rel=&#34;contact, friend&#34;&gt;Saravdv&lt;/a&gt; for taking most of the pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sony Nex-5, hands-on Review</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was given the samsung NX10 to test for 10 days, I was also handed a sony nex-5 a couple of weeks ago to play with it for one week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing posting about this camera, because to be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it. The problem is not that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the format, the quality or the technical parts of it. Actually I was very excited about those beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I not like the camera, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t intuitive. I tried to get over it and carried it with me for the whole week. The menu is not very logical, when I got the camera, I popped in a sd-card and wanted to format the card before taking pictures. Too bad it took me over 5 minutes to locate the format option in the menu. Because once you are in the menu, there are several submenu&amp;rsquo;s but the problem is that they are located vertically below each other and the camera stops scrolling for a little bit once you reach the end of the first menu. So you assume you reached the end of the menu and need to continue in another menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to that I was very annoyed by the startup time, it takes the camera 3-4 seconds to be able to take a picture. That&amp;rsquo;s too long for me. When I turn on a camera I want to be able to use it and not wait and loose the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most annoying thing was the fact that once you entered either photo or video mode, you could not review the results of the other mode without going to the unlogical menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall the camera is very nice, it would have been a great competitor compared to the samsung NX10, but sadly enough I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of pictures because after the first day I got just very annoyed with it. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope sony fixes the each of use for their next release of this camera, it has a lot of potential but I would not recommend the camera to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I think I deserve some recognitionâ€¦</title>
      <link>http://www.achter.be/20101001_i-think-i-deserve-some-recognition/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quote from &amp;#8220;The Social Network&amp;#8221;, the movie I was invited to watch yesterday in a screening together with some other bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The social network&amp;#8221; is the film about Marc Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook.com, a site I and probably you use every day. That for starters makes it very weird to watch the movie. I knew a bit about how the story of facebook goes and have to say, it stays very close to what happened in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not that big of a film geek, that I know what the director made before and what the main actors are known for, but I can appreciate a good movie and have some attention for how the film is filmed. The first thing I noticed is a very distinctive style of filming and the great use of subtle light. That makes a movie already more interesting for me. Also the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m a geek, helps when the movie is about a geek creating the biggest social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie was very fastpaced and has two law suits from in the first years of facebook nicely intertwined with the story of how facebook grew from an idea to having 1 billion members. At moments it is a bit too fast to follow, so you&amp;rsquo;ll probably miss a lot of subtle humour. But at other moments the story seemed to drag along, with the biggest anticlimax the launch of thefacebook.com. Just a press on a button and that was it, not even a beer was cracked at that moment. A bit pity but if that&amp;rsquo;s the way it went, although just for the film&amp;rsquo;s sake I would have put it in, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 2 hours is already pretty long for a movie, I found it disappointing that the biggest move facebook ever made, was not included in the film. I mean the film stopped at moving over to the UK universities and reaching there 1 billion members. I would have loved to see how it all grew and why they made the brightest and biggest move facebook could ever make, which was giving up being exclusive and going open to everybody, so that you and I now can be on facebook too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to figure out the feeling that I have after seeing the movie. I liked it, I liked it a lot. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a movie that will be a big hit, because of the niche of people that it will appeal to. I will definitely see it again, when it comes on tv or on dvd, if not only to figure out the feeling I&amp;rsquo;m left with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the trailer and thx &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adhese.com&#34; rel=&#34;contact met&#34; title=&#34;adhese.com&#34;&gt;Adhese&lt;/a&gt; for inviting me.&lt;/p&gt;
