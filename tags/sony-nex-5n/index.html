<p>Sony is really good at letting me test their new cameras. A little while ago I had the chance to test the Sony nex-5n, the successor of the nex-5. I had the pleasure of photographing with the nex-5, which I reviewed over <a href="http://www.achter.be/20101003_sony-nx-5-hands-on-review/" title="Sony Nex-5, hands-on Review" rel="me">here</a>. As I said then, I didn&rsquo;t like the menus, the startup time, &#8230;</p>

<p>The 5n is a whole different deal, in fact it&rsquo;s a great camera. Sony really listened to their users, they did a real good job cleaning up the menu-interface. It feels snappy, intuitive and very logical.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6815149410/" title="[Sony nex-5n] NOTP by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6815149410_1aaa5d034e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="[Sony nex-5n] NOTP" /></a></p>

<p>The quality of the photos is great, it can match the quality of my 5d MK II, which is about 1500 euro more expensive. The photo above is a shot of a concert at 3200 iso, with the standard jpg b/w conversion on it. There is almost no noise and the image is pretty sharp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6961267217/" title="[Sony nex-5n] Spa-Francorchamps by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6961267217_844a8bc86d.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="[Sony nex-5n] Spa-Francorchamps" /></a></p>

<p>My other concern about the nex-5 was the that the camera was pretty slow, well the 5n is definitely not slow. It has a fast autofocus, pretty short start up time, but when you can capture a race-car in full focus on a track, I can only say that it&rsquo;s really fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6815150124/" title="[Sony nex-5n] Me by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7208/6815150124_ebb4faab7d.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="[Sony nex-5n] Me" /></a></p>

<p>But as with every camera, there are a couple of drawbacks, the first being that you don&rsquo;t have a viewfinder, that&rsquo;s pretty annoying when photographing in bright light. Sony kinda solved this problem by adding a swiveling screen, a very sturdy one I have to say.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact that the flash is external, an sich not a real problem, except sony doens&rsquo;t like standard hotshoes. They didn&rsquo;t even include the typical sony hotshoe, so the only way you can use a flash is by using the included small flash, a flash I don&rsquo;t like. It&rsquo;s small, there are almost no way to control it and it feels pretty filmsy.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing, but that&rsquo;s something I have found in all Sony cameras is the way, you can review your photos and videos on it. I can imagine some people find it very good, but I don&rsquo;t want to go through the menu to view everything I have on my card.</p>

<p>Despite the few things I didn&rsquo;t like that much, the nex-5n is a very decent camera. Even so good that my girlfriend and I are actually considering buying one, how&rsquo;s that for a reference. I test a lot of mirrorless cameras and this is the first I really think is up to par with all DSLR&rsquo;s in the same or even a bit higher price range.</p>

<p><em>Thx to my girlfriend <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="There are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="contact, friend">Saravdv</a> for taking most of the pictures.</em></p>
