<p>Last wednesday I was invited on the <a href="http://www.sound.philips.com/" title="Obsessed with sound" rel="none">&#8220;Obsessed with sound event of Philips&#8221;</a> in the <a href="http://www.galaxystudios.com/" rel="none" Title="Galaxy studios mol">Galaxy studios</a> in Mol. The purpose of this event is to submerge us in sound with one of their three heroes for the campagne, the producer of the soundtrack of batman begins, Geof Foster.</p>

<p>Bert Van Daele gave us a little history lesson about how Philips has and still is obsessed with sound since the beginning. Their main ideas since the beginning are that sound should be of best possible quality and sound should be available to everyone. Along those lines they created the first affordable radio in the 1920&rsquo;s called &#8220;het kappelke&#8221;</p>

<p>In the 1940&rsquo;s philips introduced the vinyl and created the philigraph. They kept on innovating in the 1950&rsquo;s and they developed the kinetic tape. By the 1960&rsquo;s Philips Hasselt developed the compact cassette and since then it became and still is the main music carrier. In 1968 they developed the cassette in the car. In the 70&rsquo;s they developed the laser disc and they used the mpeg file format for video and audio. But in the 70&rsquo;s the emphasis for Philips was more on video then on sound. In 1982 the audio cd was invented, it gave better quality and far more storage capacity. In the 90&rsquo;s they started with DVD and SACD, where the DVD took of pretty well, the SACD was and still is a niche market. 2004 marked the date of the ambisound release and is another way to create surround sound without all the different speakers. And today we are here to see and hear the 360 sound speakers and systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775870044/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4775870044_5217ae4e09.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>Geof Foster was next up, he is the chief engineer for the batman begins soundtrack. He explained his workflow for making film music.</p>

<p>It all starts with spotting, which is basically putting some existing music against the different scenes. This process ends with a template to direct the composer. The second step is writing the music through the unique sound of the composer. The third part is scoring, this means choosing from the different sound generators like an orchestra. And the last part is a the actual mixing.</p>

<p>Geof gets involved mostly at the scoring stage, to record and create the sound, a big part of the scoring is choosing the layout and venue for the orchestra and the recording. He uses the batman begins soundtrack as an example. The recording is mostly done in separate parts. The very last thing is putting the music against the film and the sound of the movie itself. There is some more fine-tuning and listening if everything is in place.</p>

<p>Geoff also explained why the soundtrack is a little different from the music used in the film. Most music in the film is not always very interesting music wise, so they tweak it a bit for the OST</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4775212393/" title="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4775212393_df6b244aaa.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="[Event] Philips obsessed with sound" /></a></p>

<p>After that Bert explained what the 360Sound is all about. It&rsquo;s aimed at people that like good sound, but the speaker system has to be stylish. The 360Sound system has a front facing speaker and two speakers on the sides. The speakers on the side are aimed at bouncing of the walls to create a surround sound. The 360Sound is completely developed in Leuven, be.</p>

<p>The last product is the free floating tweeter, where they created a speaker which creates a full 360 degrees sound experience when the speaker is placed in the middle of the room. I like the idea, although the sound is not perfect, it is nice to have a device that sounds ok and it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are in the room.</p>

<p>Philips also released a couple of iPhone/iPod dock speakers, they sound pretty awesome, but I don&rsquo;t think they will take off until the one with the battery is released.</p>

<p>Because the whole event took place in the Galaxy studios in Mol, one of the best recording studios in the world, we were entitled to a tour trough the complex, complete with the a movie from the late 80&rsquo;s filmed during the building of the complex. It was quite impressive to see what they all did to make sure the best sound is recorded.</p>

<p>I liked the event, I liked some of the products, but I&rsquo;m not convinced they will take off with the high prices. I would have loved some more light to photograph the products. But thx [Talking Heads][4] and Philips for the invite and the Philips GoGear, which I will try to review a bitter later.</p>

				<p>Last thursday samsung gave me a nx10 camera to play with for 10 days. The camera is something in between a micro four thirds and a entry level dslr.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on giving you a full technical test of this camera, for such a review I&rsquo;ll point you towards [dpreview][1], who did an in depth review of the specs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write a more once I have tested and worked with the camera for ten days. Right now I&rsquo;m going to write down my first impressions.</p>

<p>The camera is very lightweight, fast, easy to handle and produces pictures of astonishing quality for such a small camera. Because it works with the same size chip as the entry level dslr&rsquo;s, the higher iso are acceptable in the tests I did so far.</p>

<p>Although I love most of the camera there are a couple things that need some work in my opinion. The real drawback is the electronic viewfinder. I understand they had to drop the optical viewfinder for an digital one to keep the body very small and lightweight. What I don&rsquo;t get is that the viewfinder&rsquo;s image quality is pretty bad. For sure if you compare it to the LCD on the back.</p>

<p>The second thing i don&rsquo;t like is the manual focus. First you either have to select it on camera or on the lens depending on which lens you have mounted. That&rsquo;s confusing and I don&rsquo;t like it. Second the the viewfinder zooms to help you focus, but the zoom is just showing you the same info in 4 pixels as before in one pixel. This makes it very hard to focus because what you see is all the time a bit unsharp.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m complaining about the manual focus I can only be amazed by how accurate and fast the autofocus is. It uses the contrast to focus which makes it hard to focus on a rather shallow contrast scene, but for any other circumstance it works wonders.</p>

<p>The 30mm f2 pancake lens is awesome but the kitlens (18-55mm) as with most entry level dslr&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t very good. Although the image quality is pretty ok for a standard low quality lens what disturbs me is it&rsquo;s size. The whole camera is build to being small and portable. With the kitlens the camera becomes bulky.</p>

<p>The pancake lenses are just great because of there compact size. Although at the moment you can only buy the 30mm f2, my contacts at Samsung Belgium have assured me that before the end of the year there will be a wider range of lenses available.</p>

<p>I said it would be a short review but it turned out to be an almost full review. I&rsquo;m going to take some more photographs with the camera now and will include some in the next post.</p>
