				<p>Last month I had the opportunity to play with the Samsung NX10 camera. As said in <a href="http://www.achter.be/20100620_samsung-nx10/" title="Samsung NX10">my previous post</a> I really liked the camera and that didn&rsquo;t change during the 10 days I was allowed to use it. I even wanted to keep the camera with the 20mm pancake lens. Just because it is such an amazing small and convenient camera, it can go anywhere with you and it delivers great results.</p>

<p>I used the NX10 to shoot some behind the scene material during a wedding with <a href="http://www.bertstephani.com">Bert Stephani</a>. The photos are taken with the 20mm pancake lens and as jpeg in monochrome mode. The results are very good and I like the speed, the sharpness and the fast focus it has.</p>

<p>I also tried the NX10 during the &#8220;dijlefeesten&#8221; festival in my hometown and during some other low light conditions. The results are quite exceptional, the noise is very acceptable, that&rsquo;s mainly because of the large sensor, it&rsquo;s actually only a 1.5 crop factor. But not only the noise is very acceptable, the autofocus is also very good and fast even with the lights on stage flooding the frame.</p>

<p>I can keep on talking about the technical stuff of this camera. Samsung had to make some compromises to keep the camera small but the experience with this camera is just great, I mean it just awesome to use, it&rsquo;s small, fast, easy to use, but most of all it&rsquo;s fun to use. Samsung keep up the good work.</p>

				<p>Photographing with the vredebox made me realize that I wanted to experience more of analog photography. So I started searching online for a more advanced camera. The vredebox is great, but you&rsquo;re so limited to what you can photograph with it and how. So I wanted so more control over depth of field, shutterspeed and aperture. My search let me towards the Twin Lens Reflex camera&rsquo;s. Although these camera&rsquo;s are pretty old, you still pay a good amount of money for them. I mean a mamiya or yashica changes owner for about 300 euro on ebay.</p>

<p>On <a href="hhttp://www.2dehands.be/foto-camera/" title="Foto en camera op 2dehands.be" rel="none">2dehands.be</a> I found after a lot of searching a original Rolleiflex Standard 622 from 1934 for 50 euro. I went to check it out, although it misses the plate with the serial number, everything else is in great shape. I went with it.</p>

<p>The Rolleiflex original standard model was made by Franke &amp; Heidecke in Braunschweig, Germany from 1932 to 1938. The lens is a 75mm f3.5 uncoated carl zeis lens, the shutter goes from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub> till 1 second. And off course there is a bulb mode. Apparently famous war photographer and Magnum co-founder Robert Capa used this camera during WW II, next to a contax camera.</p>

<p>I tried some different film with it, at the moment I haven&rsquo;t figured out which one I prefer but what I do know is, that this is an awsome camera. Just look at some of the results.</p>

				<p>When my grandparents died last year, my family and I had to clean out their house. I knew they had a very old camera on their chimney but I didn&rsquo;t know if it still worked. To my big surprise everything worked great, although it all could use a little cleaning.</p>

<p>I started researching the camera on the internet and found that it&rsquo;s a vredebox made by a German company called vredeborch in Friedeburg. The camera uses 120 film, has a meniscus lens with an aperture of f11. Fastest shutterspeed is 1/30th of a second. There are 3 levers on the side, one for stopping down the lens to f16 and the other 2 to use the bulb setting.</p>

<p>Those settings are a bit of a let down, but I wanted to test it out anyway. So after <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend met" title="Pieter Van Impe">Pieter</a> gave me a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 pro, I started shooting with the vredebox.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, just so you know, the minimum focus distance on this camera is 3 meters.</p>

<p>Let me first post some results and then I&rsquo;ll give a little review about the camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569687736/" title="[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3437/4569687736_dc9f8bb24e.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="[vredebox] St-Rombouts Cathedral" /></a><br />
This picture was taken on Ilford Delta 400 pro film.</p>

Taken on Ilford Delta 3200&lt;/p?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4569684332/" title="[vredebox] Hotel Vé by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3498/4569684332_708d164f30.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="[vredebox] Hotel Vé" /></a><br />
Taken on Ilford Delta 100 film</p>

<p>If you want to follow my progress with the vredebox, I suggest you follow this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/sets/72157623847114053/" rel="me" title="[Film] Vredebox on flickr.com">set on flickr</a>, I&rsquo;ll post the results there when available.</p>

<p>Now for a short review of the camera. Although it&rsquo;s technically not very good, I really like the box feeling and the way of taking pictures. Because of the lack of features or wide range of aperture and shutterspeed, I think a lot more before I make I picture. This makes that I&rsquo;m more concentrating on the framing of the shot, which is not easy in the small viewfinder located at your stomach.</p>

<p>Until now I&rsquo;m very pleased with the results of the box, a camera that&rsquo;s at least 60 year old. It&rsquo;s a decent and fun camera for hobby projects, so I&rsquo;ll be playing with it a lot more in the future</p>

				<p>On the evening of Easter I found myself with some spare time. An idea started to form in my head, just for fun I wanted to recreate a movie poster. After a <a href="http://twitter.com/Bunker/status/11601861573" rel="me" title="Bunker at twitter">tweet</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">@DeFre</a> became my instant model.</p>

<p>This left me just one hour to find a poster I wanted, think about how I would achieve the same look and prepare everything. I found this movie poster:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/upload/crank2high.jpg" alt="Movie Poster for Crank 2 High Voltage" /></p>

<p>because I knew <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">Fré</a> already, I was pretty sure it would work.</p>

<p>After some tweaking in post processing and the addition of artificial smoke, because I couldn&rsquo;t gather enough smokers on a short notice, here is the result</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/4539647013/" title="[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4539647013_541751701b.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="[personal-project] Deranged: experimental Treatment" /></a></p>

<p>The shoot was done in a total of 4 hours from idea till final image. I used 2 bowens gemini 500R studiolights with a bowens travelpak. The photo was taken in 20sec exposure while manually triggering the flashes 3 times.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the result but it&rsquo;s a start. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot while doing this and most importantly we all had a lot of fun. Big thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/defre" rel="contact met" title="DeFre at twitter.com">Fré</a> to go along with my crazy idea and <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" rel="sweetheart co-resident friend" title="Sara Van de Velde">Sara</a> for helping out, withstanding the cold and being the beer supplier of the evening.</p>
