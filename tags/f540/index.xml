      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/loneblackrider/6796342627/&#34; title=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540 by PitsLamp photography, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6796342627_8e4fea1b01.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; alt=&#34;[Samsung nx200] Logitech F540&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing the xbox late at night, while my girlfriend is asleep, isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. So I asked Logitech if I could test out the Logitech F540 wireless headphones for game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later I had the headphones. After unpacking the rather neatly put together box, it was very easy hooking it up to the Xbox. You basically plugg 2 wires into the basestation. The power and the audio cable. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After turning on the headphones and pushing the sync button on both the station and the headphones, all was set. I played several hours while wearing the headset and was very pleased with the battery life, about 10 play hours. The sound quality for me was great too, although I&amp;rsquo;m not really a sound guy, but heck it was decent enough to hear the rain fall in Oblivion which for me is all I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use the microphone in game, but it&amp;rsquo;s pleasing to hear yourself through the headphones when the mic is on, so you don&amp;rsquo;t scream when talking. I did try it once and it seemed to work decent enough, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really tell because none of the other players in the game bothered to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most headphones are quite hard to wear after a while, because my ear gets pinched, but the F540 has cups that go all around your ear, not on your ear which is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only big problem I had and what for me is kinda of a deal breaker, is that fact that I got loads of interference after a while. Especially when the Xbox was online over the wifi signal, I tried all solutions found on the web, but none really helped, except putting the transmitter at a 45 degrees angle, but that is not very handy when you need somebody to hold the transmitter while you are playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall, I like the headset a lot, but there are 2 things I didn&amp;rsquo;t like, one is that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use digital audio on it, which is very annoying because our tv only has a headphones and digital out connection and the headphones is never surround and the second one was the interference I got from other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
